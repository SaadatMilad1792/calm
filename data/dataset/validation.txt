<speaker2> This is Mr Meng speaking , Michelle .
<speaker1> Oh , hello ! Sorry about that . I'm just calling to say that we've received your new Corporate Credit Card from HQ .
<speaker2> That was quick ! I wasn't expecting it until later this week .
<speaker1> Yes , our application procedures have speeded up since we started using the new fast-track system .
<speaker2> Shall I come in and collect it ?
<speaker1> Or we can send it to you . But if you would like to use it at the ATM , you'll need to wait for your PIN number .
<speaker2> Mmmm ... if I come in and collect it this afternoon , is there any way I could use it today ? Petty cash is getting low , so I need to draw some money .
<speaker1> As long as you bring your ID , etc , we can serve you over the counter . But you won't be able to use the ATM until your new PIN number arrives .
<speaker2> I see . Yes , that's fine . I'll be there at around 2:30 pm . See you later , and thanks .

<speaker2> How long does it take to reach Taiwan by sea ?
<speaker1> Usually about two month .
<speaker2> That's too long.How long does it take to reach Taiwan by airmail ?
<speaker1> About ten days .
<speaker2> Then how much is that by airmail ?
<speaker1> Let me see.It ' s 57 dollars , 20 cents , including tax .
<speaker2> That's a little bit expensive .
<speaker1> Although it's expensive to send it by airmail , it's quicker and safer than by sea .

<speaker2> Sir , we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel .
<speaker1> You dare to doubt me ?
<speaker2> I'm sorry , sir . Let me transfer you to my supervisor .

<speaker1> Excuse me , sir , I'm afraid you can't park your car here .
<speaker2> Why not ? It's my parking space .
<speaker1> I'm afraid not , sir .
<speaker2> Oh ? That's a surprise . Let me see ... D 0411 Our dog's birthday . Yes , I'm sure this my parking space !
<speaker1> But I saw a red car always parking here before .
<speaker2> Oh , we've just repainted our car . It was red .
<speaker1> Maybe . But the car of this space has a broken rearview mirror on the left .
<speaker2> Yeah . It used to . We got that fixed yesterday too .
<speaker1> Could you wait for a minute , sir ? I'd like to have a check .

<speaker2> Tell me about it .
<speaker1> Not only is it affordable , but it comes with all the appliances .
<speaker2> What are the appliances .
<speaker1> It has an ice maker , water dispenser , and plenty of room on the inside .
<speaker2> I'd like to see it for myself .
<speaker1> Go right ahead .
<speaker2> I like what I see .

<speaker1> Oh , well . It was fun to be the winner . But ... it's too big . I must be an extra small in the States .
<speaker2> So what about the tennis racket ?
<speaker1> Look ! It's amazing . I can't wait to try it out !
<speaker2> How much did that end up costing you ?
<speaker1> Oh ... around twenty bucks . A bargain if you ask me . Look at the picture of her playing with it !
<speaker2> Hey , two for one . That's a super deal .
<speaker1> And here's her signature !

<speaker1> Can I help you ?
<speaker2> I'm looking for someone who works here , but I lost his business card . His name's Long or Sang or something like that .
<speaker1> Chang ?
<speaker2> Yeah , that sounds right .
<speaker1> There are about twenty people named Chang who work here . What department ?
<speaker2> Let me think ... accounting , finance , something like that .
<speaker1> Eric Chang in accounting ?
<speaker2> That's him !
<speaker1> I'll call him and tell him you're here .
<speaker2> I appreciate your help .
<speaker1> Would you like to have a seat over there ? It'll just be a minute . And can I have your name ?
<speaker2> Here's my card .
<speaker1> OK . I'll have him come up to get you .

<speaker1> Hello , Sir . You're here to discuss the Network Settlement Service , right ?
<speaker2> Yes , that's right . We want as much info as possible before we agree to anything .
<speaker1> Yes , it's important to be all clued up before you enter into any agreement . To make full use of the Network Settlement Service and take advantage of the whole banking system , we provide internal fund transfers , account inquiry , agency clearing to name but a few .
<speaker2> So , do you think our corporation will be eligible for this ?
<speaker1> Yes , and it's extremely simple . All you need to do is make a Network Settlement Agreement with us .

<speaker2> I am just waiting for my friends . It won't be long .
<speaker1> Sir , the curb here is not for parking .
<speaker2> But I didn't see the sign , Ma ' am .
<speaker1> There is a sign at the corner of the street . When you turned in here , you should have seen it .
<speaker2> I didn't see it .
<speaker1> I am sorry , sir . I have to give you a ticket . You can appeal to the court within 14 days . You will avoid paying the fine if you can prove that you are not at fault .

<speaker1> Are you a goal-oriented person ?
<speaker2> Yes , I am . I always make a plan before I do anything .
<speaker1> Where do you want to be in 5 years ?
<speaker2> I don't want to have a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing .
<speaker1> That sounds very reasonable .
<speaker2> It's the most important thing to me .
<speaker1> If you are hired , how long do you plan to stay with us ?
<speaker2> That obviously depends on how things go - - whether I'm suited to the firm and the firm to me .
<speaker1> Tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them .
<speaker2> I want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position . In order to achieve this goal , I just want to work step by step .
<speaker1> What is your long-range objective ?
<speaker2> I haven't thought it over at all .
<speaker1> What do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job ?
<speaker2> I think the most important thing is the interest in the job .

<speaker1> I'd like to open a current account .
<speaker2> Certainly . May I see your social security and your ID , please .
<speaker1> Here you are . I wonder how much interest can I earn from a current account .
<speaker2> Oh , current accounts don't pay out interest .
<speaker1> Why is that ?
<speaker2> It's primarily designed for business transactions . That is , writing checks to pay for bills , buying things and sending money . We won't expect a large amount of deposit in a current account .
<speaker1> I see . How do I draw money for my own use then ?

<speaker1> Good morning , Helen .
<speaker2> Good morning , Steven .
<speaker1> So , what's the status of our advertising campaign ?
<speaker2> It'll be a national campaign starting next week .
<speaker1> What style will the ads be ?
<speaker2> I suggest that we focus on slice of life , showing how you can beat the summer heat by biting into a cool ice-cream sandwich .
<speaker1> Sounds like a good idea . Will we have a new slogan ?
<speaker2> Definitely .

<speaker1> I'd like to taste some local dishes . What would you recommend ?
<speaker2> That's fine . You must try this dish .
<speaker1> Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ?
<speaker2> It's fish steamed and served with our special sauce .
<speaker1> Is it good ?
<speaker2> Sure . It's a most popular dish .
<speaker1> I think I'll try it , and give me some green salad together .
<speaker2> We have two dressings for salad . Which one would you like ?
<speaker1> What kind do you have ?
<speaker2> We have French and Thousand Island .
<speaker1> Make it Thousand Island .

<speaker1> Taxi !
<speaker2> Where will you go , sir ?
<speaker1> Friendship Hotel .
<speaker2> OK , it's not far from here .
<speaker1> I have something important to do , can you fast the speed ?
<speaker2> Sure , I'll try my best . Here we are .
<speaker1> How much should I pay you ?
<speaker2> The reading on the meter is 15 yuan .
<speaker1> Here's 20 yuan , keep the change .

<speaker1> Good morning ! What can I do for you ?
<speaker2> I'm thinking of travelling to Suzhou in July . Could you recommend some tourist programs for that ?
<speaker1> With pleasure . We arrange two kinds of tourist programs for Suzhou , a six-day tour by train and a five-day flying journey .
<speaker2> How much does a six-day tour by train cost ?
<speaker1> Five hundred yuan .
<speaker2> Does that include hotels and meals ?
<speaker1> Oh , yes , and admission tickets for places of interest as well .
<speaker2> That sounds reasonable . What about the five-day flying journey ? How much is that ?
<speaker1> Eight hundred and fifty yuan .
<speaker2> Covering all expenses ?
<speaker1> Yes . But there is no half fare for children . They must pay full fare .

<speaker1> I can't believe you wear jeans to the office ! Are you trying to lose your job ?
<speaker2> Of course not . I'm just observing casual day . On Fridays , the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire .
<speaker1> Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ?
<speaker2> We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes .
<speaker1> I guess it lets people express their individual tastes . But won't some people abuse it ?
<speaker2> Not really . Besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . People can't just wear whatever they want .
<speaker1> It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity .
<speaker2> Believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . Employees are actually more productive on casual days .

<speaker1> Hello , Mr . Wang . I am glad to meet you here at the fair .
<speaker2> Like wise . Take a seat , please . How about a cup of tea ?
<speaker1> Sure . Thank you . It seems your business is prosperous . There are many customers here .
<speaker2> Yes , it's not too bad . Our sales are going up year after year . And we still have a large potential production capacity .
<speaker1> Well , what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ?
<speaker2> That's a good idea . So far , we have several agents abroad .
<speaker1> We are willing to be your agent in Thailand for hand-held tools . What do you think ?
<speaker2> That sounds good .
<speaker1> Then , what's your usual commission rate for your agents ?
<speaker2> Usually , we give a commission of 4 % to our agents .
<speaker1> 4 % is too low , I think . You see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or TV , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . It all costs money , 4 % is not enough .
<speaker2> Don't worry . We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase .
<speaker1> You mean to saya
<speaker2> It sounds OK . Then how do you pay the commission ?
<speaker1> We may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment .
<speaker2> All right . If it's okay , we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately .
<speaker1> Think it over . We hope to keep a good business relationship with you .
<speaker2> Thank you for your help .

<speaker1> I'm glad these batteries are on sale .

<speaker2> I'm sorry . If you look at the ad again , you'll see that the other brand is on sale .
<speaker1> Oh . You're right . I misread the ad .
<speaker2> Yes , many people make that mistake .
<speaker1> Well , you can't blame them . It's a confusing ad .
<speaker2> You're right . Many ads are like that .
<speaker1> Well , as long as I'm here .
<speaker2> Just one second , and I'll give you the batteries that are on sale .

<speaker1> Hi , Jack , we are having a party tonight , wanna coming enjoy us ? You can bring your girlfriend , Tina .
<speaker2> I don't have a girlfriend . I'm single .
<speaker1> Oh , that's right . Well , there are going to be many beautiful girls at the party tonight , anyway .
<speaker2> No , I like being single . I never thought lonely , I'm focus on my career . Maybe I'll start to look for my girl when I achieve success .
<speaker1> Why is that ?
<speaker2> Because I'm living a real world , a man enriched have a good career and make a lot of money . Franklin speaking the girls I've met wounldn't married a man wounldn't make enough money .
<speaker1> I agree , a man needs good career.But that doesn't mean he should have a little fun , too .

<speaker1> How about a delicious dessert then , with our compliment ?
<speaker2> I'm not keen on dessert as a habit . They are fattening .

<speaker1> Good morning , ladies and gentlemen , we are happy you have all come out for our training workshop . Today we have a great line-up of speakers to talk to you . First on our program is a well-renown expert in the field of international economic development , Harvard's own Dr . James Smith . Dr . Smith has been involved in economic research for over twenty years , and has taught at Harvard since 1995 . And now , without further adieu , we'd like to welcome Mr . James Smith .
<speaker2> Thank you , Mr . Jackson , ladies and gentlemen , colleagues , friends . The subject of my talk is international relations in a morgen world . I plan to say a few words about the current situation in the Middle East and how it affects world economy . I'd like to give you an overview of the way that the economies of seemingly unrelated countries are intertwined . I've divided my talk into three parts , first an overview of international relations , second a discussion of current political situations , and lastly trends for the future . My presentation will take about two hours , but there will be a twenty-minute break in the middle . We'll stop for lunch at 12 .

<speaker2> Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ?
<speaker1> Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly .
<speaker2> I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable .
<speaker1> I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level .
<speaker2> I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % .
<speaker1> I
<speaker2> " Don
<speaker1> ve already cut down our price to cost level . "
<speaker2> " I

<speaker1> So , Jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ?
<speaker2> It
<speaker1> t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money .
<speaker2> Even though you are only twelve , it
<speaker1> Ve never had a bank account before . Why don
<speaker2> s almost the same as keeping it under the matters !
<speaker1> Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges . But you don
<speaker2> s go make your first depot
<speaker1> OK . Guess I have to do that before . I can make money my first withdrawal .

<speaker1> Is this where I can catch a bus to the theater ?
<speaker2> Yes , but you can't get there with out a change .
<speaker1> Which bus do I have to change ?
<speaker2> You have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 .
<speaker1> I see . Thank you .

<speaker1> Here we are , Joan . This is the Palace museum , also known as the Forbidden city .
<speaker2> Oh , how splendid ! Can you take a picture of me here ?
<speaker1> Sure .

<speaker1> Excuse me . I'm afraid I got lost . Where am I on this map ?
<speaker2> We are here , bus station , we are in the heart of the city .
<speaker1> Oh ! Can I go from here to the Zhongshan Park ?
<speaker2> Head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right .

<speaker1> Tony , could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ?
<speaker2> Working hours are from 8: 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . Be sure not to be late or absent . Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month .
<speaker1> Is there anything else ? How about my salary ?
<speaker2> Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record .
<speaker1> Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ?
<speaker2> All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days .
<speaker1> Okay , that's good . I get it .

<speaker1> Kate , you never believe what's happened .
<speaker2> What do you mean ?
<speaker1> Masha and Hero are getting divorced .
<speaker2> You are kidding . What happened ?
<speaker1> Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce .
<speaker2> That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ?
<speaker1> Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out .
<speaker2> That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ?
<speaker1> Early in the New Year I guess .

<speaker1> Overseas operator .
<speaker2> I would like to make a collect call to Taipei , Taiwan , please .

<speaker1> Hello . Excuse me .
<speaker2> Yes . Can I help you ?
<speaker1> Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago .
<speaker2> Of course I remember you .
<speaker1> I think I lost my wallet here .
<speaker2> Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything .
<speaker1> Really ? You didn't find a wallet ?
<speaker2> No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ?
<speaker1> Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left ?
<speaker2> No . It's been empty the whole time .
<speaker1> Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened .
<speaker2> I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ?
<speaker1> No . My friend did .
<speaker2> Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ?
<speaker1> No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table .
<speaker2> Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home .
<speaker1> I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ?
<speaker2> Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that .
<speaker1> Should I call the police ?
<speaker2> You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets .
<speaker1> Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home .
<speaker2> I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir .
<speaker1> Thanks for your help .

<speaker1> Good morning , young lady . You can call me Ma . Do you see anything you like ?

<speaker2> It sounds like a special quilt . Why do you want to sell it ?
<speaker1> Well , this home is too big for me now , so I'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller . Therefore , I need to part with a few things .
<speaker2> Oh , I see . Umm , how much do you want for the quilt ?

<speaker1> t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ?
<speaker2> Yes . I

<speaker1> Are you in a hurry ?
<speaker2> I have to be there before 17 o'clock .
<speaker1> We'll make it except a jam . You know it's rush hour .
<speaker2> There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
<speaker1> I'll do my best .
<speaker2> Here's twenty dollars .
<speaker1> Do you have small bills ?
<speaker2> No . If you can't break it , keep the change . But can you give me a receipt ?
<speaker1> Here is your receipt . Thank you .

<speaker1> Recently I have been getting headache and my eyes don't seems to see focus properly .

<speaker2> Yes , there is an underground car park near the supermarket .

<speaker1> Oh , come on , Ultraman !
<speaker2> What's up , Bro ? What's in the bulletin ?
<speaker1> It says that there will be a blackout from 5 p . m . to 7 p . m . in our neighborhood today .
<speaker2> Blackout ? Even the TV has the limit .
<speaker1> Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?
<speaker2> Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either !
<speaker1> That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ?
<speaker2> Oh , my god ! No air-conditioner !
<speaker1> OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here .
<speaker2> How about playing Barbie out there in the neighborhood ?
<speaker1> Barbie ? You know , I might be seven , but I'm not a girl .
<speaker2> Do you have a better plan ?
<speaker1> All right , all right .

<speaker1> Yes , ma'am , how could I help you ?
<speaker2> I am wondering if you do facial care ?
<speaker1> Yes , we do .
<speaker2> How much would it be ?
<speaker1> From 200 to 800 .
<speaker2> I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ?
<speaker1> No problem .

<speaker1> Can I help you , Miss ?
<speaker2> I would like to order 2 office-style cabinets and desk calendars . We want office-style cabinets in white . The catalogue number is 90 - f - 2356 .

<speaker1> Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview .
<speaker2> It is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time .
<speaker1> You'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview .
<speaker2> The contents should be mainly descriptions of your background . And the length depends on the particular situation .
<speaker1> Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation .
<speaker2> To sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression .
<speaker1> Selling yourself should go straight to the point , and the statement should be clear and brief .
<speaker2> It should also be truthful and realistic . Do not blindly blow your own horn .
<speaker1> You should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for .
<speaker2> While you should not omit your weak points , they need to be described appropriately
<speaker1> Time permitted , you could add certain examples to your description .
<speaker2> Besides , in the interview , it is best that you make corresponding adjustments to apply your prepared contents flexibly .

<speaker1> Hello ?
<speaker2> Hi , Deborah ! This is John . I'm calling from Australia .
<speaker1> What are you doing in Australia ?
<speaker2> I'm attending a conference in Sydney this week . Remember ?
<speaker1> Oh , right . What time is it there ?
<speaker2> It's 10:00 P . M . And it's four o'clock in Los Angeles , right ?
<speaker1> Yes - four o'clock in the morning .
<speaker2> 4:00 A . M . ? I'm really sorry .
<speaker1> That's OK . I'm awake now .

<speaker1> John hasn't turned up and Stefan is ill . Do we have anyone on stand-by ?
<speaker2> I'm afraid not , we're very short-staffed at the moment . Can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime ? Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement .

<speaker1> Jack , let

<speaker1> Hello . May I speak to Jerry , please ?
<speaker2> Sorry , but he is out for lunch right now .

<speaker2> I think he will be back around 2:00 . If you like , please leave your name and phone number , I'll have him call you as soon as he comes back .
<speaker1> That's nice . My name is Steven , my phone number is 6789777 . Okay , I'll be waiting for his call . Thank you and bye !
<speaker2> My pleasure , bye !

<speaker1> Excuse me , Miss .
<speaker2> What can I do for you ?
<speaker1> I've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed .
<speaker2> What's your flight number ?
<speaker1> Flight CA216 to Chengdu .
<speaker2> Yes , it's true . It has been delayed .
<speaker1> Could you please tell me why ?
<speaker2> Yes , of course . The delay is due to heavy rain .
<speaker1> How long will the delay be ? Do you have any further information about it ?
<speaker2> I am sorry , we don't know the extent of the delay at present . But according to the latest weather forecast , there will be a change in weather soon .
<speaker1> We have to wait . Well , is it possible for the rain to stop before noon ?
<speaker2> It's hard to say . Weather is so changeable in the summer . Please listen to the latest announcement about your flight .
<speaker1> Yes , I will . Thanks a lot . Bye !
<speaker2> Bye

<speaker1> What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck !
<speaker2> I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .
<speaker1> I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !
<speaker2> I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ?
<speaker1> I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .
<speaker2> Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?
<speaker1> I don't know .
<speaker2> I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .
<speaker1> What do you mean ?
<speaker2> We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .
<speaker1> I have plenty of gas .
<speaker2> Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .
<speaker1> So what can we do ?
<speaker2> Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible .
<speaker1> Alright . That's a good idea .
<speaker2> I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .
<speaker1> Days ?
<speaker2> Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .
<speaker1> Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .
<speaker2> Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .

<speaker1> Hey , buddy , can

<speaker2> Oh , well you don
<speaker1> s all right , though . Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A .

<speaker1> Can I help you ?
<speaker2> I'd like the double cheese burger meal , please .
<speaker1> What kind of drink would you like with that ?
<speaker2> Just coke will be fine .
<speaker1> Would you like a super size meal ? Only 2 RIB more , you'll get large coke and fries instead of medium . And today we are offering free toys all the meal boxes .
<speaker2> That sounds good , thanks , I'd like that . Actually I'd like sprite instead of coke , thanks .
<speaker1> That's not a problem , Miss . Will that be it ?
<speaker2> Yes , that's all .
<speaker1> That will be 25RMB , please
<speaker2> You got it .

<speaker1> Do you have any night tours ?
<speaker2> Yes , we will depart in 10 minutes .
<speaker1> Is that a guided tour ?
<speaker2> Yes , it is .
<speaker1> That's fine . Let's get on the bus .

<speaker1> I am sure we will make it up as soon as possible .
<speaker2> That's nice .
<speaker1> We hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings .
<speaker2> Of course not . We have cooperated for a long time .

<speaker1> I would like to purchase some meat .
<speaker2> What kind of meat would you like to get today ?
<speaker1> First off , I'm going to need a pound of ground beef .
<speaker2> A pound of ground beef is $ 2.48 .
<speaker1> That's perfect .
<speaker2> What else will you be needing ?
<speaker1> I'm also going to need three pounds of chicken breasts .
<speaker2> The chicken breasts cost $ 4.05 per pound .
<speaker1> What's the total price for the chicken ?
<speaker2> It's going to be $ 12.15 .
<speaker1> Okay , I think that will be all for me today .

<speaker1> I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks .
<speaker2> Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us .
<speaker1> Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market .
<speaker2> Do you sell direct to shops ?
<speaker1> Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen .
<speaker2> Do you keep a stock of these things ?
<speaker1> In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course .
<speaker2> That is , your commission .
<speaker1> Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal .
<speaker2> Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission .
<speaker1> The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much .
<speaker2> According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ?
<speaker1> We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with .
<speaker2> We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ...
<speaker1> Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ?
<speaker2> Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect .
<speaker1> Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products .
<speaker2> Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details .
<speaker1> Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ?
<speaker2> Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction .
<speaker1> All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency .
<speaker2> Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair .

<speaker1> Excuse me , I
<speaker2> t arrived yet .
<speaker1> Certainly , Ms . Ransom . Do you have an order number ?

<speaker1> Have you worked out the offers . Mr . Thou ?
<speaker2> Yes , we have . Here's our CIF quotation sheet . Please have a careful look .
<speaker1> Are the prices on the list firm offers ?
<speaker2> Yes . All the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation .
<speaker1> I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices .
<speaker2> All these products are our best-selling lines . The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . And we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . What do you have in mind ?
<speaker1> How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan .
<speaker2> I understand . Our offer remains open for 4 days .

<speaker1> Hello sir , may I help you ?
<speaker2> Yeah , I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
<speaker1> I see . Well , you have come to the right place . We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers .
<speaker2> Sounds good . I don

<speaker1> We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet !
<speaker2> Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy or a kitty !
<speaker1> Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
<speaker2> I will ! I
<speaker1> re planning on having children soon , I don
<speaker2> s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome !
<speaker1> I
<speaker2> ll take it from there .
<speaker1> Yay !

<speaker1> Good evening , Mr . Lee and thank you for choosing our airline . We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ?

<speaker2> Do I have to work on weekend ? If so , how do you pay for the overtime ?

<speaker2> Is there probation ?
<speaker1> No probation is involved . If you feel good , you can start next week .

<speaker2> In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it
<speaker1> s a lot of weight !
<speaker2> It
<speaker1> m ok ...

<speaker1> Excuse me.Could you tell me how to return to the Hilton Hotel ? I am afraid I lost my way .
<speaker2> Do you have a hotel card or something ?
<speaker1> Let's see.Yes , I have the address and telephone number here .

<speaker1> Well , I don't understand it very well.Will you draw me a map ?

<speaker1> Excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ?

<speaker1> How long will it take me to get there ?
<speaker2> It's about a ten-minute walk .
<speaker1> That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you .
<speaker2> Not at all .

<speaker1> How does the political system work in your country ?
<speaker2> We have hundreds of constituencies and the voters in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp
<speaker1> s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime Finist
<speaker2> What
<speaker1> s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
<speaker2> Can any mp make a law ?
<speaker1> Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law .
<speaker2> I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
<speaker1> Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp
<speaker2> s vote the way their party wants them to .
<speaker1> How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
<speaker2> They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Voters who often change the party they vote for are Calle

You should keep smiling always , being polite when you talk with the interviewer . Don't move from time to time when you sit there . And you also should know how to use eye contact .

<speaker1> Hi , Sam . I want to buy a pet . Do you have any ideas ?
<speaker2> You really should go to Rachel's pet store .
<speaker1> why ? anything special there ?
<speaker2> it's more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more .
<speaker1> Oh , really ? are there any snakes ?
<speaker2> snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets .
<speaker1> that's terrific . I can't wait to check it out .
<speaker2> Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ?
<speaker1> why not ? it's so cool .
<speaker2> but it will pose a risk to your health .
<speaker1> pardon ?
<speaker2> i mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems .
<speaker1> well , I didn't realize that .
<speaker2> I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .
<speaker1> oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .
<speaker2> yes , good luck , Maria .

<speaker1> IBA , Jane speaking . How can I help you ?
<speaker2> Hello . I'd like to speak to someone regarding my card .
<speaker1> Sorry , I'm not quite sure if I understand . In what way , Sir ? Has your card been stolen ?
<speaker2> No , no . Nothing at all like that . It's just that I applied for a credit card with you a while ago , my application was accepted , but I'm still waiting for my card .
<speaker1> Oh , I see , Sir . Well , it does take 5 working days to issue and post the card .
<speaker2> Yes , my application was accepted last Friday . Now it's Wednesday , that's more than 5 days .
<speaker1> Sorry , Sir , but it's 5 working days . This does not include weekends , so your card should be with you later this week .
<speaker2> Of course ! How silly of me ! Yes , 5 working days would mean this Friday , at the earliest . I see . I'm sorry to trouble you .
<speaker1> It's no trouble at all , Sir . Is there anything else I can help you with today ?
<speaker2> Nothing , thanks . I again apologise for the misunderstanding , bye for now .

<speaker1> What can I do for you , sir ?
<speaker2> We'd like to order breakfast for tomorrow morning .
<speaker1> Yes , sir . What would you like ?
<speaker2> Orange juice , scrambled eggs , bacon , toast and coffee .
<speaker1> OK , and when shall I bring it here ?
<speaker2> About seven thirty.By the way , could you also bring me tomorrow's papers ?
<speaker1> Of course , sir .

<speaker1> What shall we do when we find a shortage in the shipment ?
<speaker2> You should do one of the two things - either to lodge a claim with the shipowner or with the insurance company .
<speaker1> Shall we leave it to the brokers ?
<speaker2> Yes . They usually do it .
<speaker1> Do they charge for that ?
<speaker2> Of course . In Europe , they charge a commission of 1 % of the amount of the claim for their service .
<speaker1> Is it the same in America ?
<speaker2> They do the work without charge to the importer .
<speaker1> It's part of their service , isn't it ?
<speaker2> Exactly .
<speaker1> Is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ?
<speaker2> No , you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment .
<speaker1> I see . By the way , how do we prove the ownership of our goods ?
<speaker2> You must provide full original set of ocean bills of lading original insurance policy or certificate and the original commercia invoice .
<speaker1> I see . Thank you .
<speaker2> You are welcome .

<speaker1> I'll be on business for a couple of days , could you take care of your sister ?

<speaker1> I
<speaker2> s go grab a bite to eat .
<speaker1> Yeah me too . Oh ! Can we stop at the shop really fast ? I lost my makeup bag at the airport and I want to pick up a few things .
<speaker2> Will you take long ?
<speaker1> No ! Five minutes I promise !
<speaker2> Come on ! We have been here for almost an hour ! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish !
<speaker1> Are you crazy ? You have no idea what you are talking about ! Just for my eyes I have to get eye-liner , an eyelash curler , eye shadow , an eyebrow pencil and mascara . Then I need to get foundation , liquid foundation .
<speaker2> Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I
<speaker1> s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon !
<speaker2> What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ...

<speaker1> Well , they come in white , pale yellow , aqua , red and green . Will a white one do ?
<speaker2> Yes . I prefer white - and may I see a pale yellow one , too ?
<speaker1> Why , of course . Let's see ... White ... Pale yellow . Here you are , sir .

<speaker2> Yes , I like it very much .

<speaker2> No , I'm not .
<speaker1> What are you going to do ? Are you going to work late ?
<speaker2> No , I'm not . I'm going to look for an apartment .
<speaker1> An apartment ? Why ?
<speaker2> I'm going to try to find a place near the office .
<speaker1> Where are you living now ?
<speaker2> Out in the suburbs . It's a long trip to work every day .
<speaker1> How are you going to find an apartment ?
<speaker2> I'm going to buy a newspaper and check the classified ads .
<speaker1> Apartments in the city are expensive .
<speaker2> I know , but I'm going to enroll in a night school to take a course in business management .

<speaker1> no , no , you helped me with my computer last week . I want to repay the favor .
<speaker2> no , it's definitely my turn to treat you ... you paid last time !
<speaker1> oh , that was just a quick bite to eat---that doesn't count !
<speaker2> ok , ok , how about we just go Dutch ? It's settled . Listen , I'm still pretty new around here , would it be alright if you found the restaurant ?
<speaker1> ok ... sure .

<speaker1> I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there
<speaker2> s wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ?
<speaker1> Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ?
<speaker2> Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out .

<speaker1> Hey , Jim . It's time to wake up and get out of bed .
<speaker2> Do I have to get up now ?
<speaker1> You'd better get up , or you'll be late .
<speaker2> What're you talking about ? My alarm even hasn't gone off yet .
<speaker1> Yes , it did . It went off thirty minutes ago . You slept right through it . You're like a dead person while you sleep .
<speaker2> I must have slept right through it .
<speaker1> Rise and shine ! Sleepyhead !
<speaker2> Just let me sleep five more minutes .
<speaker1> The early bird gets the worm .
<speaker2> I know , I know . But I don't want any worms .
<speaker1> Ha ! Ha ! If you don't make an effort now , later on it'll be a lot tougher for you .

<speaker1> What shall we do tonight ?
<speaker2> How about the cinema ?
<speaker1> That's a good idea . We haven't seen a film for ages . What would you like to see ?
<speaker2> Oh I don't know . Titanic ?

<speaker1> I

<speaker1> Sit down , please . What's wrong with you ?
<speaker2> I feel cold , and I'm shivering . I have a terrible headache and a sore throat .
<speaker1> How long have you been like that ?
<speaker2> About a day .
<speaker1> Let me have a look at your throat first . Please open your mouth and say " ah " .
<speaker2> Ah ...
<speaker1> And show me your tongue ... Thank you . That'll do . You have slight tonsillitis , and your throat is inflamed . How is your appetite ?
<speaker2> Not so good .
<speaker1> Now , let me take your temperature . Please put this thermometer under your armpit and let me feel your pulse ?
<speaker2> Your pulse is weak .
<speaker1> Do I have a temperature , doctor ?
<speaker2> Yes , you have a high fever . I'd like to give you a blood test .

<speaker1> Yikes ! What was that noise ?
<speaker2> I had to blow my nose .
<speaker1> Did you have to blow right next to the phone ?
<speaker2> Did you hear that ?
<speaker1> Of course I heard that . I thought a plane had crashed into your house .
<speaker2> It wasn't that loud .
<speaker1> I will blow my nose sometime for you , and you'll see .
<speaker2> Okay . I'll take your word for it .
<speaker1> I thought you had an elephant in your house .
<speaker2> You're funny .
<speaker1> What did you say ? I think I've gone deaf .
<speaker2> I'm going into the bathroom to blow my nose . I'll be right back .

<speaker1> Can I have the check please ?
<speaker2> Right away , sir .
<speaker1> Is this amount correct ?
<speaker2> Yes , sir , it is .
<speaker1> Thank you , the service was good
<speaker2> Please come again .

<speaker1> Nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . So I am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive .
<speaker2> What you said is true . But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . For example , to make more movie Ccds , so people will spend money buying them .
<speaker1> But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past .
<speaker2> Yes . Take myself for example . I seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead , I see films at home-watching Ccds .

<speaker1> Okay , well I
<speaker2> d like to clarify .
<speaker1> Well feel free to ask me anything , and I
<speaker2> s quite an important point , isn
<speaker1> t include a generous housing allowance also .
<speaker2> I understand . And are there other bonuses included ?
<speaker1> Well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . But we could go through all the details of that at a later date .
<speaker2> Well , Mr . Parsons , I am flexible when it comes to salary . The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me .
<speaker1> Excellent . Well , what other questions do you have Rebecca ?

<speaker1> We need to take the accounts system offline to carry out the upgrade . But don't worry , it won't cause too much inconvenience . We're going to do it over the weekend .

<speaker1> We'll be taking everything offline in about two hours ' time . It'll be down for a minimum of twelve hours . If everything goes according to plan , it should be up again by 6 pm on Saturday .
<speaker2> That's fine . We've allowed forty-eight hours to be on the safe side .

<speaker1> How much is your last salary ?
<speaker2> I have earned 10,000 a year including bonuses .
<speaker1> How much do you want us to pay you ?
<speaker2> I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 150,000 a year . To be honest , I left the company to get more income .

<speaker1> I hope you can help . I've got a bit of a problem with your ATM .
<speaker2> Of course , that's my job . Oh , dear . What's happened ?
<speaker1> Well , it's eaten my card ! It won't give it back !
<speaker2> I see ... calm down , don't worry . May I ask what were you doing when it took your card ?
<speaker1> Yes . I was only entering my PIN . I'm terrible at remembering it , I'm so forgetful , you see .
<speaker2> Mmmm ... and exactly how many times did you enter it , please ?
<speaker1> Maybe three times . As I said , I always forget it .
<speaker2> Ah ! Don't worry ; it's just a security measure . If someone uses a card and cannot get the right PIN after three attempts , the bank keeps the card in case it's stolen . Just contact the bank and we'll get it back to you .
<speaker1> Oh , I see . So if I call my branch they can sort everything out for me ?
<speaker2> Yes , they'll be happy to help . Believe me , it happens to many people .
<speaker1> I'd better try harder to memorise my PIN in future . Thanks .

<speaker1> No , certainly not .

<speaker2> Not really . There aren't any used bookcases listed . But there are a few rummage sales on Saturday . I think I'll go to them .
<speaker1> Do you mind if I go with you ?
<speaker2> Not at all . These private sales are great places to bargain . And sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .

<speaker1> Mr . Dick . Does the recommendation of the university play an important role ?
<speaker2> Yes . In fact , the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation . In the long period of cooperation , the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations , they trust each other well . If your university recommends you , you can be approved more easily .
<speaker1> But I find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . So I doubt its authority .
<speaker2> More and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy . If your university also does like this , you can look for other methods , because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you .
<speaker1> Could you tell me whether or not I send out my resume with it ?
<speaker2> It depends . If it has something special or useful , I suggest you send it out .

<speaker1> Taylor , can you tell me how to apply for a job on the Internet ?
<speaker2> Just fill out an application .
<speaker1> Do I have to send an E-mail ?
<speaker2> You are expected to know the E-mail address of the unit .
<speaker1> But I still don't know which unit is in need of staff .
<speaker2> Send out an application through Job-wanted on the website .
<speaker1> Can any unit see my information ?
<speaker2> It's a two-way choice . And your application will be read .
<speaker1> Which websites offer this service ?
<speaker2> Sina , 21st Century Talent Net , and a few others .
<speaker1> Thank you .

<speaker1> Don
<speaker2> t bear you any more .
<speaker1> I dare you to say that again .

<speaker1> Were you a leader when you were in college ?
<speaker2> Yes . I was Propaganda department minister of our university .

<speaker2> Yes . That is why I'm here .
<speaker1> Tell me your argument .
<speaker2> I was pulled over for allegedly speeding .
<speaker1> Are you sure you weren't speeding ?
<speaker2> To be honest , I really wasn't .
<speaker1> What speed were you going ?
<speaker2> I was under the speed limit . I was going 35 , when the speed limit was 40 .
<speaker1> I'm just going to let you go , since the arresting officer isn't here .
<speaker2> What about my ticket ? Do I still need to pay ?
<speaker1> Don't worry about it .
<speaker2> I'm so glad for your help .

<speaker1> Annie , do you like shopping online ?
<speaker2> Yes , I like it , because it's convenient .
<speaker1> Last week , I tried to buy a new cellphone online , but I didn't know how to pay for it .
<speaker2> First , you should open an account at the online bank . After that , you can buy anything you want online .
<speaker1> Are there many things online ?
<speaker2> Sure . You can find everything all over the world . Let's check it out online ! ( They log in a shopping website . )
<speaker1> That's amazing . Oh , an on line virtual supermarket ?
<speaker2> Let's click to check it out .

<speaker1> Ah , Bob . Just the person I wanted to see .
<speaker2> So what is it ?
<speaker1> You gotta help me out this time , buddy .
<speaker2> Another tough thing , I guess .

<speaker1> Hey ! What happened ? ! My song was only half way through and it skipped to the next song .
<speaker2> I don't know what happened !

<speaker1> Sure , here is my driver's license .
<speaker2> Please sign here .

<speaker1> Are you ready to order ?
<speaker2> I think that we have a pretty good idea of what we would like to order .
<speaker1> Let me tell you about the specials of the day , which are chicken in a wine sauce with capers , and grilled garlic shrimp .
<speaker2> I was wondering if the chef could leave off the sauce .
<speaker1> The chef would be happy to accommodate your special requests .
<speaker2> I am a vegetarian . Do you have any vegetarian selections ?
<speaker1> You could choose the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza or the goat cheese and candied walnut salad .
<speaker2> I think that we will split the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza .
<speaker1> That is a good selection , and I can bring your salads now or serve them with your entree .
<speaker2> You can bring us our salads when you bring us our entree .

<speaker1> We're considering of ordering 200 computers , but I'm wondering about the price you'll possibly offer .
<speaker2> Our price will be not less than $ 5000 .
<speaker1> Your price is higher than I expected . Could you give us a little discount ?
<speaker2> This is already our best price .
<speaker1> But the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order .
<speaker2> Well , what would you suggest ?
<speaker1> Could you make it $ 4500 ?
<speaker2> I'm afraid that there is no room to negotiate the price . This is the best price we can quote .
<speaker1> Can we meet each other half way ?
<speaker2> What do you mean ?
<speaker1> Let's close the deal at $ 4800 , OK ?
<speaker2> You drive a hard bargain ! OK , that's a deal .

<speaker1> I'm now on the Songshan airport getting ready for departure . I realized that I might have left my watch .
<speaker2> Yes , Ma'am . May I have your name and room number ?
<speaker1> My name is Terry . I stayed last night in your hotel in room 132 .
<speaker2> What kind of watch is it ?
<speaker1> It's a brand-new Seiko wrist watch .
<speaker2> Yes , we have it .
<speaker1> Oh , I'm glad to hear that . Would you kindly send it to the Hilton Hotel ?

<speaker1> What are your thoughts on the apartment ?
<speaker2> I think that it
<speaker1> t any problems with the apartment ?
<speaker2> I think that the apartment looks very nice , but I do see some problems .
<speaker1> What problems ?
<speaker2> I did notice a few stains in the carpet .
<speaker1> We will have the carpet cleaned before you move in .
<speaker2> You will ?
<speaker1> Yes , but other than that , are there any more problems ?
<speaker2> That was the only thing that I saw that was wrong with the apartment .
<speaker1> I

<speaker1> That China-gown of Tang-Dynasty style is so beautiful . Would you show it to me , please ?
<speaker2> Absolutely . Here it is .
<speaker1> Could I try it on ?
<speaker2> Please do , the fitting-room is over there .
<speaker1> It feels a little tight around the waist . Do you have a bigger one ?
<speaker2> I'm sorry . We don't have this color in your size . We have some green ones in your size . Would you please have a look at this green one ?
<speaker1> OK . How much does it cost ?
<speaker2> It's 486 yuan .

<speaker1> Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ?
<speaker2> As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap .
<speaker1> Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling .
<speaker2> So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide .
<speaker1> The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ?
<speaker2> To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken .
<speaker1> That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut .
<speaker2> I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion .
<speaker1> Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ?
<speaker2> Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ?
<speaker1> Good . Friday morning at 9 .

<speaker1> Good morning .

<speaker2> Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch !
<speaker1> But you bought it only last month .
<speaker2> Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired .

<speaker2> I think about ten minutes by bus .
<speaker1> It's not far away , then . Let's walk , it's beginning to rain .
<speaker2> Wait ! I think I see a bus coming now . Let's hope it's the No . 22 bus .

<speaker1> Hi , Mr . Smith . I'm Doctor Hawkins . Why are you here today ?
<speaker2> I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up .
<speaker1> Yes , well , you haven't had one for 5 years . You should have one every year .
<speaker2> I know . I figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ?
<speaker1> Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So try to come at least once a year for your own good .
<speaker2> Ok .
<speaker1> Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ?
<speaker2> Yes .
<speaker1> Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit .
<speaker2> I've tried hundreds of times , but I just can't seem to kick the habit .
<speaker1> Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I'll give you more information before you leave .
<speaker2> Ok , thanks doctor .

<speaker2> I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible .
<speaker1> I trust your judgement . Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now .

<speaker1> Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache .
<speaker2> You should go to the dentist .
<speaker1> I hate dentists .
<speaker2> Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .
<speaker1> It always hurts . I hate going .
<speaker2> Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .
<speaker1> O . K . , O . K . , I
<speaker2> " Good . You

<speaker1> Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please .
<speaker2> Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm .
<speaker1> How long does it take to get there ?
<speaker2> About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you
<speaker1> ll take it .
<speaker2> Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train !
<speaker1> I understand . Thank you very much !
<speaker2> Have a great trip .

<speaker1> I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend .
<speaker2> A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ?
<speaker1> The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend .
<speaker2> So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ?
<speaker1> It sounds like it will be .
<speaker2> I really hope it doesn't get cold .
<speaker1> That would ruin things , I want to go so badly .
<speaker2> The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know .
<speaker1> That is true . The weather is constantly changing .
<speaker2> It would be nice if the weather would never change .
<speaker1> That would be great , then we could plan things sooner .
<speaker2> True . Predictable weather would make life easier .

<speaker1> Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other .
<speaker2> If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company .
<speaker1> Beneficial ? I don

<speaker1> Do you eat a lot of healthy food ?
<speaker2> Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind .
<speaker1> You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt .
<speaker2> What's special about these things ?
<speaker1> Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled .
<speaker2> Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now .

<speaker1> I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job .
<speaker2> You need to take a break , maybe a vacation .
<speaker1> Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment .
<speaker2> Is that so ?
<speaker1> Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on .
<speaker2> Have you decided ?
<speaker1> Yes . I want to get a better job .
<speaker2> Could you tell me why you want to quit ?
<speaker1> I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
<speaker2> Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ?
<speaker1> I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .
<speaker2> OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
<speaker1> Thank you so much for your advice .
<speaker2> And every best wish for your new job .
<speaker1> Thank you .

<speaker1> The train is leaving . Hurry up ! Which car are we in ?
<speaker2> Let me see . Oh , No . 11 .
<speaker1> Here we are , Car 11 . Let's get in .
<speaker2> Seats No . 20 and 21 . It
<speaker1> Ve got a window seat .
<speaker2> Let's put our suitcases on the rack .
<speaker1> Oh , the baggage rack is full . Put them under the seat for the time being .
<speaker2> All right .

<speaker1> So , how should we get to the theatre ?
<speaker2> Let's take the bus .
<speaker1> I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .
<speaker2> It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once .
<speaker1> It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .
<speaker2> We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .
<speaker1> Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .
<speaker2> If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?
<speaker1> We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi .
<speaker2> I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus .
<speaker1> Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .
<speaker2> It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .
<speaker1> Thanks , that was nice of you .
<speaker2> See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !

<speaker1> Let's go over this plan again .
<speaker2> From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg .
<speaker1> And that is mostly flat , right ?
<speaker2> Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba .
<speaker1> And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ?
<speaker2> That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop .
<speaker1> It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride .
<speaker2> Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ?

<speaker1> Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ?
<speaker2> I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her .
<speaker1> I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . Room 908 is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet .
<speaker2> Anyhow , I'd like to change our room .
<speaker1> No problem , sir . We'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . Could you wait till tomorrow ? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning . There'll be some rooms for you to choose from .
<speaker2> All right . I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep .
<speaker1> Be sure . I'll make a note of that . Everything will be taken care of . And if there is anything more you need , please let us know .

<speaker1> It's time for bed .
<speaker2> I'm not ready to go to sleep . I'm not tired .
<speaker1> It's quite late , and you have an early day tomorrow .
<speaker2> I'm not going to be able to fall asleep .
<speaker1> Why don't you try counting sheep ?
<speaker2> I've tried that before . It really doesn't work .
<speaker1> That's beside the point , you still need to go to bed .
<speaker2> Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep ?
<speaker1> If I let you do that , then you're just going to be up all night .
<speaker2> I promise I'll go to sleep soon .
<speaker1> No , you're going to sleep now , so good night .
<speaker2> See you in the morning .

<speaker1> I see myself as being honest , diligent , persevering and creative . And I have a strong sense of responsibility .
<speaker2> How about your psychological resilience ?
<speaker1> I think I can work well under pressure , if necessary .
<speaker2> How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ?
<speaker1> I will just be sincere and friendly to others , and I believe they will treat me the same way .
<speaker2> You seem to be a kind-hearted lady .
<speaker1> Thank you . I simply believe the goodness of human nature .
<speaker2> Please tell me your weaknesses if you can .
<speaker1> I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details . I am always in pursuit of perfection .

<speaker1> Karen ? I need to go over a few things with you .
<speaker2> Certainly . Mr . Graham . When would you like to meet ?
<speaker1> I was thinking about this afternoon , after the sales meeting .
<speaker2> Fine . At 3:30 ?

<speaker1> I believe we ' Ve met before . My name's David .
<speaker2> Yes , at your company , I think . I'm Frank .
<speaker1> Oh , I remember now.Very nice to meet you again .
<speaker2> Nice meeting you , too .

<speaker1> I made my little brother cry .
<speaker2> Shame on you !

<speaker1> I need some mascara . Do you have good thickening mascara ?
<speaker2> Of course . Here is our thickening mascara . We also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes .
<speaker1> Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too . Do you have a color chart can look at ?
<speaker2> We have a very wide selection of colors . And our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin . So it is very gentle on your eyelids . Would you like to sample some ?
<speaker1> Oh , sure I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first .
<speaker2> I can help you with that .
<speaker1> Thank you .

<speaker1> Is this the baggage claim area for flight KB256 ?
<speaker2> Yes , we are on the same plane .
<speaker1> But I am a transfer passenger . I have a connecting flight to Miami .
<speaker2> So you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area .
<speaker1> Yes.It ' s quite troublesome .
<speaker2> Why not go and find a porter ?

<speaker1> Billy , you don
<speaker2> re playing football ! I love football !
<speaker1> You
<speaker2> t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What
<speaker1> t know . It was there when I woke up this morning .
<speaker2> It
<speaker1> d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ?
<speaker2> I bashed it against the chair in my room .
<speaker1> Does it hurt ?
<speaker2> A little , but not much .
<speaker1> Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I
<speaker2> s after breakfast .
<speaker1> If I

<speaker1> This is your schedule .
<speaker2> You're going out of your way for us , I believe .
<speaker1> You are our honored guests .

<speaker1> Are there any vacancies still available ?
<speaker2> Yes . We need a plumber here .
<speaker1> I am looking for a job that is more advanced than that , such as sales manager or regional manager .
<speaker2> I am sorry . They are not available now .

<speaker1> My name is Mary , and I will be your waitress tonight .
<speaker2> Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant .
<speaker1> Before your main course , would you like to order an appetizer ?
<speaker2> Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ?
<speaker1> There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table .
<speaker2> The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ?
<speaker1> You know , that is one of my favorites !
<speaker2> OK , I'll take one order of that .
<speaker1> You could choose another appetizer for half price to share .
<speaker2> Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings .

<speaker1> I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there's something wrong with the fax machine .
<speaker2> What's wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ?
<speaker1> Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ?
<speaker2> Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out .

<speaker1> I would like to speak to you , if you don
<speaker2> s election .
<speaker1> Is that right ?
<speaker2> I am a volunteer for this year
<speaker1> s wonderful . I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand .
<speaker2> I know history is about to be made , and I would like to be a part of it .
<speaker1> That
<speaker2> m going to vote .
<speaker1> Go to your polling place early on Election Day .
<speaker2> I will . Good luck with your volunteering .

<speaker1> We hope that there will be no repetition of this kind of trouble in the future .
<speaker2> Yes . I promise it will not happen again .
<speaker1> We look forward to your settlement at an early date .
<speaker2> We will inform you as soon as possible .

<speaker1> Hello , Steven . How do you get along with your job ?
<speaker2> Actually , I learn many things from it . I find that I am a quick learner in new things .
<speaker1> Practice makes perfect . By the way , what do you learn from your job ?
<speaker2> At first I didn't know anything about the machine . Now I know how to operate it . Besides , the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement .
<speaker1> Yeah , you are a good learner . I must commend you for your good performance .
<speaker2> Thank you . That's a long way to go for my job .
<speaker1> I appreciate your effort very much . The coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work .
<speaker2> OK , let's go .

<speaker1> Where on earth are we ?
<speaker2> Judging by all the traffic , I'd say we're near the outskirts of the city .
<speaker1> What did I do wrong ? Did I take a wrong turn ?
<speaker2> I'm not sure , but I think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge .
<speaker1> Well , now we should turn back a few kilometres .
<speaker2> It seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map .

<speaker1> Hello . Front desk .
<speaker2> Yes . This is Bob Robinson . I
<speaker1> s noisy for me . I have a problem sleeping . And I feel uncomfortable when I take an elevator .
<speaker2> So you need a quiet side room on the lower floor .
<speaker1> You
<speaker2> Ve only two rooms on the first floor . How about room 108 ?
<speaker1> That
<speaker2> ll send the bellman to help you .
<speaker1> Oh , thank you kindly .
<speaker2> You

<speaker1> How long will it take for our order to be delivered ?
<speaker2> Let's see . You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles .
<speaker1> Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control .
<speaker2> No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go .

<speaker1> Now you're my boss , Mr . Henry .
<speaker2> Do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
<speaker1> No , nothing in particular .
<speaker2> You may ask questions about us , if you have any .
<speaker1> All right . When can I start ?

<speaker1> What are you doing here today ?
<speaker2> I would like to fight my ticket .
<speaker1> Is the arresting officer in the courtroom today ?
<speaker2> Yes , the officer is here today .
<speaker1> What's your case ?
<speaker2> I was pulled over for running a red light , but I never did .
<speaker1> Do you believe that the officer lied ?
<speaker2> There was a camera on the signal . So , he was obviously lying .
<speaker1> Your license plate was caught on camera ?
<speaker2> A picture of my license plate was never taken .
<speaker1> Since there is no picture of your license plate on record , I'm going to let you go .
<speaker2> Thank you . I'm glad that you believe me .

<speaker1> Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ?
<speaker2> Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long .
<speaker1> Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices .
<speaker2> That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options .
<speaker1> What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ?
<speaker2> Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into .
<speaker1> So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?
<speaker2> Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .
<speaker1> Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will .
<speaker2> After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I

<speaker1> what shall we do after the volleyball match ?
<speaker2> how about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym .
<speaker1> that's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
<speaker2> me , too . What did you have in mind ?
<speaker1> I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must .
<speaker2> I agree . They\
<speaker1> Huan Huan
<speaker2> " the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they
<speaker1> ' oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ? '
<speaker2> t think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now . "
<speaker1> " it all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can

<speaker1> Mom ! I hate eating vegetables !
<speaker2> You don
<speaker1> t mind .
<speaker2> Thanks mom ! Can I have dessert now ? I love chocolate cake !
<speaker1> No dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables .
<speaker2> But I don
<speaker1> s not fair !
<speaker2> You can have some fruit for dessert . If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake .
<speaker1> Ok ... actually , I don
<speaker2> ll remember that for next time . You

<speaker1> It was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place . It gave me a good idea of your product range .
<speaker2> It
<speaker1> s your general impression , may I ask ?
<speaker2> Very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your NW Model .
<speaker1> That

<speaker1> Is the factory fully-automated ?
<speaker2> Not completely . Our production process is partially-automated . We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually .
<speaker1> What about supply of parts to the production line ?
<speaker2> Well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line .
<speaker1> What about the smaller components ?
<speaker2> They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory .

<speaker1> I'm glad you're on your ten-year reunion planning committee .
<speaker2> Yeah , you get the TV to yourself while I spend my nights surfing the Net for missing classmates .
<speaker1> That's not why . This way I can see how you guys do this sort of thing .
<speaker2> I guess . Don't you have reunions in Taiwan ?
<speaker1> Definitely . Every year . But just for our forty-person class .
<speaker2> Ours are for everyone that graduated in the same year .

<speaker1> What does your job involve ?
<speaker2> I'm the Project Manager so I have to make sure our projects run smoothly . I work with three Project Engineers . They take care of after-sales service and look after the maintenance side of the business .

<speaker1> How many languages can you speak ?
<speaker2> Besides Chinese , I can speak English and French .
<speaker1> You mean you can read and write both of them ?
<speaker2> No , I can only carry on a simple conversation in French .
<speaker1> Can you read and write English well ?
<speaker2> I can speak the language better than read and write .
<speaker1> Do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of English-speaking countries ?
<speaker2> I think so . I used to be an interpreter .
<speaker1> Do you think your English is good enough to do desk work ?
<speaker2> The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm .

<speaker1> What can I get for you ? Here is the menu .
<speaker2> Let me have a look . Well , how many kinds of steaks do you have ?
<speaker1> We have sirloin steaks , pepper steak , and filet steak .
<speaker2> Is there something go with the filet steak ?
<speaker1> Yes , we have various sauces . What about the gravy ?

<speaker1> Are you ready to go shopping ?
<speaker2> Just a minute . I need to make a list of thinks that we need .
<speaker1> Good idea . Have you written down potatoes , carrots , and onions ?
<speaker2> I don
<speaker1> ll add them . We should get some tea . Is green tea ok or should we get the same tea that we usually get ?
<speaker2> Let
<speaker1> s my list . Is there anything that I
<speaker2> Ve got everything . I want to got some chocolate and some cheese .
<speaker1> What kind of cheese do you want .
<speaker2> I
<speaker1> ll decide at the cheese counter , when I can see what they have . Have we got enough money ?
<speaker2> We don
<speaker1> ll take my credit card and we can pay with that . Where are the car keys ?
<speaker2> I

<speaker1> Hello , can you tell me how to use the telephone ?
<speaker2> If you want to order meals , call 8801.If you need other help , call 8803 and someone will be there .
<speaker1> Thank you so much . By the way , is there a mail service ?
<speaker2> Yes , you can take your letters to the counter over there .

<speaker1> Hi , I am afraid that the fax machine in my room won

<speaker1> How many years have you done business with China ?
<speaker2> Let me see , about five years , we established our business relationship with Hua Mei of China Import & Export Corporation in 2003 .
<speaker1> Do you have any difficulties in doing business in China ? You know the Chinese economic legislation is still incomplete ?
<speaker2> I don't think I have any problem with our Chinese partners . They have always followed the contract strictly . We can do business directly with the corporation . As I mentioned before , the Chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law . Its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies .
<speaker1> Well , it's known that the Sino-American relation is in a dilemma . Does it influence your business in China ?
<speaker2> Actually not at present . But we are afraid it will . You know policies influence business to some extent . I hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists . China is really a large market . We don't want to lose it .
<speaker1> Thank you .
<speaker2> You're welcome .

<speaker1> Give me a pack of first-class stamps , please .
<speaker2> Here you are . That will be five dollars . Anything else ?
<speaker1> Yes . I want some post cards and some airmail stamps . I want to send some letters to South America .
<speaker2> Just a moment , I'll look up the rate for air-mail letters to South America .
<speaker1> Can you tell me how much it will cost to send a package to Colombia ? Also , I what to know how long it will take .
<speaker2> Do you have the package with you ? I would have to weigh it to see how much it would cost .
<speaker1> Do you insure package ?
<speaker2> Yes . All you have to do declare the value of the package and decide how much you want to insure it for .
<speaker1> Is there a way that I can be sure that the people in South america receive my package ?
<speaker2> The post office rarely loses package . You can , however , request a rectum receipt .
<speaker1> One last question-what are your hours ?
<speaker2> We open at eight-thirty in the morning and close at five-thirty in the afternoon .
<speaker1> Thank you , you helped me a lot .

<speaker1> Hello , thank you for taking the time to interview me .
<speaker2> Hi there , I
<speaker1> t like to sit around and so like to always find things to do to keep myself busy .
<speaker2> That is good to hear !

<speaker1> Good morning . SRC international . How may I help you ?
<speaker2> Good morning . I'd like to speak to Peter . Chen Please .
<speaker1> Certainly . Who should I say is calling ?
<speaker2> This is Tim . Hunter from Hunter industries .
<speaker1> And what is it regarding please ?
<speaker2> We have an appointment for this afternoon . Mr . Chen will know why I'm calling .
<speaker1> Of course , Please hold the line Mr . Hunter .

<speaker1> Right , let me run through your options . You can go ahead and cash your undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate if you really want to , but I'd recommend a Personal Durable Commodities Loan .
<speaker2> OK , what does that entail ?
<speaker1> It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . If you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances .
<speaker2> Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ?
<speaker1> Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate .
<speaker2> I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ?
<speaker1> Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu .
<speaker2> Absolutely , Jenny . Thanks very much , I think you've saved me quite a lot of money today .

<speaker1> My aunt told me one of her secrets--cellophane tape .
<speaker2> I just got it at the special health store . It's for my flabby arms .
<speaker1> Let me know how it works .
<speaker2> I have to say , I have had enough of this roller coaster .
<speaker1> I know what you mean . I'm like a yo-yo .
<speaker2> Last week I was down to 60 kilos . This week I had one donut more . Now I'm up to 62 kilos .

<speaker1> May I have a menu , please ?
<speaker2> Of course .
<speaker1> Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ?
<speaker2> Lobster ? It is steamed and served with our special sauce .
<speaker1> Is it good ?
<speaker2> Sure . It is a most popular dish .
<speaker1> I think I will try some lobster , and give me some green salad together .

<speaker1> Can
<speaker2> m afraid I must . Look at it ! It
<speaker1> t you remember ? I had to water it every day .
<speaker2> Well , I
<speaker1> s raining . That means you needn

<speaker1> I'm broke , and I have to catch another bus .
<speaker2> Why don't you have any money for another bus ?
<speaker1> I got hungry and bought some chips .
<speaker2> That was smart .
<speaker1> Anyway , do you have any change I can use for the bus ?
<speaker2> I don't have any .
<speaker1> I don't know how I'm going to get home .
<speaker2> Get a transfer from the bus driver .
<speaker1> How much is a transfer ?
<speaker2> It doesn't cost anything .
<speaker1> That's great ! Thanks for your help .
<speaker2> You know what ? Don't mention it .

<speaker1> Hello , Anna . Come in and sit down .
<speaker2> Hello , doctor .
<speaker1> What's the matter ?
<speaker2> I've got a backache .
<speaker1> Do you often suffer from backache ?
<speaker2> No , I don't . I've never had a bad one before .
<speaker1> When did it start ?
<speaker2> About four days ago .

<speaker2> That is good . And here I give you a piece of advice . You should have used stronger cardboard boxes for such a heavy item . Besides , it's better to secure the cartons with metal straps . What's more , the order number wasn't anywhere on some of the boxes .
<speaker1> I realize that now . I will do that after a while .
<speaker2> Thank you . Can I open the packages to check the color and style ?
<speaker1> Of course , let me help you .
<speaker2> The color and style are consistent with the sample . Great !
<speaker1> You know , we are superior to other clothes companies .
<speaker2> Yes , that's for sure . There is nothing wrong with the quality . I think you'd better pack them first in plastic bags , than in cartons .
<speaker1> OK . We will manage it later .

<speaker2> How long have you been feeling this way ?
<speaker1> It all started the day before yesterday .
<speaker2> You seem to have picked up some kind of infection .
<speaker1> What should I do ?

<speaker1> Hello , Mr . Thomas . Could you spare a minute ?
<speaker2> What do you need ?
<speaker1> I need to talk to you about that new driver you

<speaker1> I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable !
<speaker2> Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him .
<speaker1> He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .
<speaker2> I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .
<speaker1> I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me .
<speaker2> Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss .
<speaker1> Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .
<speaker2> Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper .
<speaker1> I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?
<speaker2> I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions .

<speaker1> hey , you look great ! how's everything ?
<speaker2> yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit .
<speaker1> really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work .
<speaker2> it's important to do proper exercises .
<speaker1> you're right . Too much or too little won't do any good .
<speaker2> the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet .
<speaker1> sounds reasonable .
<speaker2> we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
<speaker1> and fruits !
<speaker2> surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .
<speaker1> I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
<speaker2> yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can help one to keep sound physical health .
<speaker1> I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .
<speaker2> you bet it !

<speaker1> Staying out all night , you frightened me to death .
<speaker2> I stayed with my friends .
<speaker1> You should at least give me a call .
<speaker2> I'm sorry , Mum .

<speaker1> Did anyone call ?
<speaker2> Just Mr . White .
<speaker1> What did he want ?
<speaker2> He wouldn't say over the phone .

<speaker1> What kind of job do you intend to do ?
<speaker2> I want to do some management job since I have three-year's work history .
<speaker1> What are your plans if you were hired ?
<speaker2> I would apply my specialty and experience to my job and gradually move up to the management level in this company .

<speaker1> You stepped on my foot !
<speaker2> Sorry . I didn't mean to .

<speaker1> what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ?
<speaker2> while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement .
<speaker1> why not ?
<speaker2> the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing !
<speaker1> it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking .
<speaker2> I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children .
<speaker1> I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking .
<speaker2> all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty .
<speaker1> perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow .
<speaker2> I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them .
<speaker1> that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad .
<speaker2> you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking .

<speaker1> Good morning . Could I speak with Mr . Willard please ?
<speaker2> This is he . Who

<speaker1> Can you tell me the differences between a letter and a memorandum , Miss Thong ?
<speaker2> Certainly . A letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted . A memorandum is a communication within an organization .
<speaker1> Should we use the layout we use for a letter when we write a memorandum ?
<speaker2> No , not necessary . Usually we have a set form which is printed . We just fill in the printed forms and send it to the person or the offices concerned in the company .
<speaker1> Of course , let me find one for you .

<speaker1> Hi , do you have any tickets for the show tonight ?
<speaker2> Sorry , it

<speaker2> Where would you like to sit ?
<speaker1> Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes .
<speaker2> Certainly .

<speaker1> Lily , I am terribly sorry about this . But we have to put off or cancel tomorrow's meeting .
<speaker2> Cancelled ? That's just can't happen !
<speaker1> Sorry to say , but nothing can be done . The equipment broke down and can't be fixed till Friday .
<speaker2> Oh , I hope it be fixed on Friday .

<speaker1> Overseas operator , may I help you ?
<speaker2> Yes . I would like to place a collect call .
<speaker1> Can you tell me the name and number of the person you want ?
<speaker2> Terry and his number is 4562325 8 .
<speaker1> Please wait a moment . It Will take a few seconds to get through .

<speaker1> Would you help me figure out what to do about the office party ?
<speaker2> I would be happy to help . What would you like me to help with , food or entertainment ?
<speaker1> I would like to help you with both .
<speaker2> That will work out fine . To make sure everything goes together , do you think this party should be casual or dressy ?
<speaker1> A dressy party would be fun !
<speaker2> That will work out fine . Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best ?
<speaker1> We should probably have both .
<speaker2> Yes , that will work out fine . Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ ?
<speaker1> Maybe we could do both !
<speaker2> Everything sounds great then ! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details .

<speaker1> I can't find the price tag .
<speaker2> It's right here . $ 100 .
<speaker1> But I heard other stores were having great mark-downs on this item .
<speaker2> Ours are of really good quality .
<speaker1> I see , please wrap it .

<speaker1> Peter , how often do you exercise ?
<speaker2> Well , I swim and run every day .
<speaker1> Now , tell me , what do you eat ?
<speaker2> Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .
<speaker1> Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
<speaker2> Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
<speaker1> What do you drink ?
<speaker2> Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .
<speaker1> What do you drink ?

<speaker1> Where can I call a taxi ?
<speaker2> There's a taxi rank over there , right outside the gate .

<speaker1> How did your company's fundraiser go ?
<speaker2> The fundraiser events went really well . We were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society . All of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research .
<speaker1> So how does it work ? How were you able to make money with the marathon ?
<speaker2> Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars .
<speaker1> Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society .
<speaker2> In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause .

<speaker1> How may I help you today ?
<speaker2> I need to open a second account .
<speaker1> What kind of account would you like to open ?
<speaker2> I need another savings account .
<speaker1> Do you have another account with us ?
<speaker2> I sure do .
<speaker1> Would you like to transfer money from that account into your new one ?
<speaker2> That
<speaker1> s fine . Thank you .

<speaker1> How about your grades of study ?
<speaker2> I have been doing quite well . As reach 90 % and Bs reach 100 % . And I
<speaker1> s a very important experience for me . First , it improved my organizing ability , and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective . Second , it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who I like or dislike .
<speaker2> In your spare time , do you have any part time jobs ?
<speaker1> Yes , I used to work as an assistant lawyer for Tienda Law Office .

<speaker1> What kind of a car do you have ?
<speaker2> An old one .
<speaker1> I know it's old , but what make is it ?
<speaker2> It's a Chevrolet . Why do you ask ? You going into the car business ?
<speaker1> Nothing like that . My cousin is going to take a job overseas and he can't take his car with him , so he's going to sell it - cheap . It's practically new .
<speaker2> well I have been thinking about getting a newer car . I can't afford a brand new one .
<speaker1> Would you like to look at my cousin's car ?
<speaker2> Is it a four-door or a two-door ?
<speaker1> It's a coupe with a vinyl roof .
<speaker2> Does it have automatic transmission ? .
<speaker1> Yes , and it also has power steering , power brakes , and air conditioning .
<speaker2> I guess I might take a look at it .

<speaker1> What is my prime responsibility in daily work ?
<speaker2> Your main job is serving the clients and giving them what they want .
<speaker1> What other things do I need to know ?
<speaker2> You'd spend 30 % of your time on the computer . You may be bored with a job like that .
<speaker1> No problem . I am used to it .

<speaker1> Good afternoon . May I help you ?
<speaker2> Yes , I
<speaker1> ll let her know you
<speaker2> s Josh O
<speaker1> ll show you to her office , right this way .

<speaker1> How about your interview ?
<speaker2> They turned me down .
<speaker1> Why ? You are so excellent .
<speaker2> I think the only reason is that I was too nervous during the interview and I couldn't express myself the way I wanted to .
<speaker1> What a shame ! You should have showed yourself to them !
<speaker2> It doesn't matter . I'll try other companies .
<speaker1> I suggest you hunt for a job on the Internet .
<speaker2> On the Internet ? I've never heard of it .
<speaker1> It's very convenient and it has become popular recently .
<speaker2> Is that safe ?
<speaker1> Of course , if you log on some standard websites .
<speaker2> Thank you for your advice . I'll have a try .

<speaker1> We are here .

<speaker1> Well , you're no gentleman , either .
<speaker2> Okay , lady , just to show what a gentleman I really am , I'll let you go in front of me . Now , just buy your ticket and shut your trap , will you , lady ?
<speaker1> Whew ! I got the last one . This must be my lucky day !
<speaker2> What was that you just said ? Last one ... ? Hey , they've closed the ticket window !
<speaker1> Yes , I'm afraid I bought the last ticket , and to think , if you hadn't been such a gentleman . . .
<speaker2> Lady ! This is unfair ! I've been cheated ! I was in line before you.That should have been my ticket ! Come on , hand it over , lady !

<speaker1> I don't believe so . He's going out of town on business . May I take a message ?
<speaker2> I have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o'clock , but I'm afraid I can't make it .
<speaker1> Would you care to make another appointment ?

<speaker1> I see . I can tell Mr.Thomas that you phoned .
<speaker2> Thank you .
<speaker1> Bye-bye .

<speaker1> Good morning , Mr Zhang , I wonder whether you have got an answer from your superior .
<speaker2> Yes , we had a meting about it yesterday afternoon .
<speaker1> What's the answer ?
<speaker2> We decided that we could agree to your price , but we are a bit worried about the slow delivery .
<speaker1> Let me see . I quoted your delivery in three months , didn't I ?
<speaker2> Yes , but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible .
<speaker1> I thought you would be worried about it . So I rang Auckland last night . As you are our biggest customer , they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave Auckland next month .
<speaker2> Good , if you agree we'll draft the agreement right away and sign it then .
<speaker1> By all means .

<speaker1> Be careful . The floor is wet .
<speaker2> What happened ?
<speaker1> I spilled my drink .

<speaker1> Hello , this is Lucie Jing calling from Lincoln Bank . May I speak to Mr Was , please ?

<speaker1> That will be sent on to you within 2 working days . Then , you can start using your new card .
<speaker2> Great . I'll be in later today . Thanks for calling . Bye .

<speaker1> What are we eating for lunch ?
<speaker2> I have no idea . What about you ?
<speaker1> I kind of want pizza .
<speaker2> I ate pizza the other day .
<speaker1> So , what do you feel like eating then ?
<speaker2> How about some burgers ?
<speaker1> I already had a burger yesterday .
<speaker2> What are we going to do ?
<speaker1> We can just each get what we want to get .
<speaker2> That sounds like a plan .
<speaker1> Do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ?
<speaker2> I think they sell both at the cafeteria .

<speaker1> Did you bring your certificate for nursing ?
<speaker2> Yes , here is my Certificate of Nurse .
<speaker1> How about your nursing education ?
<speaker2> I learnt nursing through theory and practice for 3 years at Hunan Nursing School .
<speaker1> Can you manage English conversation ?
<speaker2> Yes , pretty well . I have started learning English since primary school .

<speaker1> Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ?
<speaker2> My husband and I have thought about it , but we've decided not to have any . They're just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of Worl
<speaker1> Well , I've always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ?
<speaker2> For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share .
<speaker1> Don't you think you would miss having other people around ?
<speaker2> No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy
<speaker1> If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ?
<speaker2> That's true . But as a woman , I'm glad that even though I don't want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can't imagine what China would be like
<speaker1> Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ?
<speaker2> I don't know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children !

<speaker1> Ok , let
<speaker2> t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses !
<speaker1> I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
<speaker2> Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .
<speaker1> So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ?
<speaker2> Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
<speaker1> Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it
<speaker2> ll just have everything dry cleaned .

<speaker1> Is Tom in ?
<speaker2> No , he is at work now .
<speaker1> May I have his office phone number please ?
<speaker2> Sure . It's 289,1234 .

<speaker1> What about driving to Shanghai ?
<speaker2> Driving ? No way , it's too far .
<speaker1> I just thought it would be an interesting way to see lots of places . How long will it take ?
<speaker2> Too long , and you do not have much time .
<speaker1> What a pity .

<speaker1> Good afternoon . I'll show you to your room .
<speaker2> Thank you .
<speaker1> Could you tell me which bags are yours ?
<speaker2> They're over there next to the door . Those three with green tags on them .
<speaker1> Could you wait a moment ? I have to get a trolley . May I see your room key , please ?
<speaker2> Sure , here it is .
<speaker1> Thank you . Room 402 . You're on the 4th floor . This way , please .

<speaker1> Excuse me , sir . Is there anything I can do for you ?
<speaker2> Yes . I bought the can two days ago , but today I found that is beyond the guarantee period .
<speaker1> Let me see . I am sorry , sir . We will change another one for you . Please wait a moment .

<speaker1> Excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ?
<speaker2> The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . The station is at the end of that street .
<speaker1> How long will it take me to get there ?
<speaker2> It's about a ten-minute walk .
<speaker1> That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you .
<speaker2> Not at all .

<speaker1> Excuse me ! Does this bus go to the railway station ?
<speaker2> No , You're got on the wrong bus . You can take a No . 22 bus at the University station and then transfer to a No . 83 bus at the railway station .
<speaker1> OK ! Thank you very much !

<speaker1> I have here our price sheet on a F . O . B . basis . The prices are given without engagement .
<speaker2> Good , if you
<speaker1> ll go over the sheet right now .
<speaker2> Take your time .
<speaker1> I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high .
<speaker2> I
<speaker1> s reasonable , isn
<speaker2> ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly .
<speaker1> The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let
<speaker2> Ve said , if your order is large enough , we
<speaker1> t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent .
<speaker2> How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ?
<speaker1> To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help .
<speaker2> Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ?
<speaker1> I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It

<speaker1> Excuse me , you look lost.Can I help you ?
<speaker2> Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station .
<speaker1> Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right .
<speaker2> Right ? OK , got it .
<speaker1> Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ?
<speaker2> Next left then right ? OK .

<speaker1> I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said .
<speaker2> I said , ' Do you want me to help you ? '
<speaker1> I'm trying to find a post office .
<speaker2> Go three blocks and turn right . It's right there .
<speaker1> Should I take the bus ?
<speaker2> No . It'll only take about five minutes to walk .
<speaker1> Thank you very much .
<speaker2> Anytime .

<speaker1> It says here that you graduated from Beijing Normal University with a major in English Language and Literature .
<speaker2> Right . Then you may think that I am not fit for this job according to my educational background .
<speaker1> Yes .
<speaker2> But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people . So I took an evening course at the Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate .
<speaker1> So you must be an extravert ?
<speaker2> Yes , I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them .
<speaker1> What do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ?
<speaker2> A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities , and offering service of transportation , accommodation , sightseeing , shopping and entertainment .
<speaker1> Don't you consider it a hard work ?
<speaker2> Hard but interesting , I think .
<speaker1> Have you any experience as a tourist guide ?
<speaker2> Yes , I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University .
<speaker1> Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English ?
<speaker2> Yes , I have learned a little French and Japanese as well .

<speaker1> Didn
<speaker2> t know the rule about punching .
<speaker1> That
<speaker2> clock and punch out after 5 o
<speaker1> clock .
<speaker2> May I ask whether we need to work overtime ?
<speaker1> Sometimes , but not quite often .

<speaker1> This needs dry-cleaning.Can you remove this stain without harming the fabric ?
<speaker2> Let me see . We
<speaker1> m not sure that we can remove it .
<speaker2> Ok , then . We
<speaker1> d also like to have this pressed .
<speaker2> Any starch ?
<speaker1> No starch .

<speaker1> What's the problem ?
<speaker2> I have a laceration on my left forearm .
<speaker1> Let me have a look . How did this happen ?
<speaker2> I got hit by a car in an accident .
<speaker1> Was there much bleeding afterward ?
<speaker2> No , not much .
<speaker1> Well , this doesn't look too serious . Nurse , could you please get me a suture set ?
<speaker2> Will I need stitches ?
<speaker1> Yes . Three , I think . It wont ' be too painful . Alright , we're done . That wasn't so bad , was it ?
<speaker2> No , not really .
<speaker1> You're lucky there was no lasting damage . I'll set up an appointment for you to come back in five days . We'll take those stitches out then . So long .
<speaker2> Thank you , doctor . Bye .

<speaker1> What time is it ?
<speaker2> Ten to nine .
<speaker1> Your watch is ten minutes slow . So it's should be nine sharp . I'm gonna be late again . What will be my excuse this time ? It should be set the alarm for seven thirty .
<speaker2> Don't cry over spilled milk , Fred ? Could you stay with me a few minutes ?
<speaker1> What ? Why ? What's wrong with you ?
<speaker2> I just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking.It ' s so lonely and boring . My sickness makes it worse . When will I recover ?
<speaker1> You will be fine in the couple of month , just be patient . I've got to woke now , I'll be late .
<speaker2> You only care about your work .
<speaker1> Sorry , baby , you are everything to me . all I do just for our family .
<speaker2> Stay just a few minutes longer , OK ?

<speaker1> How is the result of your lab test ?
<speaker2> When it comes to that , I have a lot to say .
<speaker1> Then say it .
<speaker2> When I went back to my doctor to hear the results of my lab tests , I tried to keep a poker face even though I was scared to death . Then you guess what he said .
<speaker1> That

<speaker1> Could you tell me something about your family ?
<speaker2> OK . There are five people in my family , Father , mother , elder brother , younger sister and I .

<speaker2> My brother has found his job and my sister is still in college .
<speaker1> What does your father do ?
<speaker2> My father is a middle school teacher .
<speaker1> What about your mother ?
<speaker2> My mother is a housewife .
<speaker1> Are you married ?
<speaker2> I am not married yet and I live alone now .
<speaker1> Do you need to support your family ?
<speaker2> No , my father and brother are doing that .
<speaker1> Have you finished school ?
<speaker2> Yes , I have already graduated .

<speaker1> I'm in heaven ! A Whirlpool dryer !
<speaker2> I love them , too . Let's move into the kitchen . Wait until you see the refrigerator .
<speaker1> This is too good to be true .
<speaker2> And the stove is brand new . You know how to use a gas stove , right ?
<speaker1> Yes . We've lived in Taiwan for a while . I had a gas stove in the States , too .
<speaker2> It's better for cooking Chinese food . Well , what do you think ?
<speaker1> We love it . But we'd like to know about the neighbors .

<speaker1> How's your new car ?
<speaker2> Perfect ! Couldn't be better .
<speaker1> You made a good choice , then ?
<speaker2> It's just what I want .
<speaker1> No regrets ?
<speaker2> I am really pleased with it .
<speaker1> I am glad you are happy .
<speaker2> It's super .

<speaker1> Good afternoon , Sir . You're here to see about a Temporary Loan , right ? The loans we offer are for purchasing income-generating assets . Is that what you require ?
<speaker2> Yes , that's exactly what I need . How about terms for these ?
<speaker1> Well , we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans . The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period .
<speaker2> Is there any flexibility on that ?
<speaker1> Unfortunately , not .
<speaker2> OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan .
<speaker1> Not a problem , Sir . If you'd just fill out these forms , and of course with necessary clearance , we can get you the money right away .

<speaker1> Mr . Wang , I've had scheduled for your two days stay in Shanghai . You can make some changes if it does not suit you .
<speaker2> All right . Please read it to me .
<speaker1> On Friday morning , Mr . Wang , the director of Shanghai Research Institute , will visit you at the hotel . In the afternoon , you will discuss some problems with Mr . Yang , vice manager of computer corporation .
<speaker2> Very good .
<speaker1> On Saturday , you'll leave the hotel for sightseeing . Miss Lu will be your guide .
<speaker2> Oh , that's great .

<speaker1> Hi , I would like to return this TV .
<speaker2> Sure , do you have the receipt ?
<speaker1> Yeah here you go . Actually I also want to return this keyboard .
<speaker2> Ok . may I ask what is the reason for returning these products ?
<speaker1> The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear .
<speaker2> I see , and what about the keyboard ?
<speaker1> I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work .
<speaker2> I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages .
<speaker1> Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways .

<speaker1> There are so many people that the tickets are all sold out !
<speaker2> Luckily we got the last two .
<speaker1> Look , Danny . The Four Great Inventions !
<speaker2> Gunpowder , compass , the paper making , and the printing .
<speaker1> I really admire those who made such great inventions !
<speaker2> May , I don't see why they are great . They are just simple things .
<speaker1> They look simple today . But they were milestones in their times .
<speaker2> Milestones ? May , you must be kidding .
<speaker1> Just think Bill Gates , those inventions are as important as the windows system .
<speaker2> Well , I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them .
<speaker1> No , quite the contrary .
<speaker2> Why ? Didn't you say that they were milestones ?
<speaker1> Yes , but they went to the public without any patent protection .
<speaker2> Well , their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates .

<speaker1> What can I do for you ?
<speaker2> I need some medicine .
<speaker1> For whom ?
<speaker2> My wife . She suffers from a bad cold .
<speaker1> What symptoms does she have ?
<speaker2> Fever and a bad cough .
<speaker1> I see . Don't worry , just a common cold .
<speaker2> What kind of medicine does she need ?
<speaker1> Patulin will be enough .
<speaker2> How many pills for each time ?
<speaker1> Nine pills per day , and three pills after each meal .
<speaker2> Thank you very much .
<speaker1> It's my pleasure .

<speaker1> Do you believe in god ?
<speaker2> Not at all . I
<speaker1> m not sure . Why don
<speaker2> t explained yet .
<speaker1> I
<speaker2> t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs .

<speaker1> Didn't you say your friend was American ? Where is she going on her honeymoon ?
<speaker2> They're going skiing in Colorado .
<speaker1> What a coincidence ! These pajamas would be perfect to take along on the honeymoon !
<speaker2> You're probably right . Oh , what the heck ! I'll take it all ... in maroon , like you said .

<speaker1> What a terrible house !
<speaker2> I'm sick of it , too .
<speaker1> The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart .
<speaker2> It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out .
<speaker1> Sure .

<speaker1> Hi there . Welcome to Lincoln Corporate Services . How can we help ?
<speaker2> Hi . I was wondering what kind of fixed asset loans you have ? Do you have Fixed Asset Loans ?
<speaker1> Yes , we do . You'll go through the acceptance application , then a first review , then an evaluation and examination and finally get approval . Why don't you read through this brochure ? It outlines all of the important aspects of the loan , the terms and conditions , etc .
<speaker2> That's a good idea , to familiarise myself with it . Then , I'll be back if we decide to go ahead .

<speaker1> There are many art craft items in this shop . I suggest you take your time , and you might find something you like .
<speaker2> That's what I am going to do .
<speaker1> If you have any problem , please come to me .
<speaker2> I surely will . How much is this wood carving ?
<speaker1> You are an expert on it . That wood carving is very rare . But I'm so sorry . that is not for sell .
<speaker2> That's OK . Is anything else recommended ?
<speaker1> Do you have any special request ?
<speaker2> I'd like to see some traditional arts .
<speaker1> So that means you are shopping for presents ?
<speaker2> Yes , I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends .
<speaker1> Actually , I think the paper-cuts is OK , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . They think that is a miracle .
<speaker2> Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut .
<speaker1> I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best .
<speaker2> You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale .
<speaker1> As a matter of fact , I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts . I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country .
<speaker2> Wow , you are the expert on it .

<speaker1> Operator . Can I help you ?
<speaker2> I'd like to make a person-to-person call to Beijing , China . The number is 2135367 8 , and I want to speak to Mr . Zhang .
<speaker1> To Mr . Zhang in at 2135-3678 ?
<speaker2> Yes , that's right .
<speaker1> May I have your name and telephone number ?
<speaker2> My name is Luo Gang , and the phone number is 513-3284 .
<speaker1> Mr . Luo , will you hold the line , please - - - Mr . Luo , there is no Zhang at that number . Will you check the number again , please ?
<speaker2> What the number I gave you , operator ?
<speaker1> It's 2135-3678 .
<speaker2> Oh , I'm sorry . should have been 2135-3668 , not 3678 . I've given you a wrong number .
<speaker1> Are you sure this time ?
<speaker2> Yes .
<speaker1> OK . Let me try again .
<speaker2> Thank you .

<speaker1> Are there any special requirements on the project ? And shall we talk around it in details ?
<speaker2> Yes , there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it . Besides , you see , in recent years , we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness .
<speaker1> That's a good idea . We can improve our technology to meet your special need .
<speaker2> And please let white color dominate .
<speaker1> OK ! I've noted it down . And any others ?
<speaker2> Oh ! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city .
<speaker1> I'll tell them .
<speaker2> Well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor .
<speaker1> Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery .
<speaker2> Thanks a lot . And I believe I'll have a good time working with you .
<speaker1> I think so . Bye !
<speaker2> Bye !

<speaker1> Mr . Black , I ' d like to take some time off . I ' Ve been feeling exhausted these days .
<speaker2> That's no problem . Let me see ... You still have ten days annual leave left , is that right ?
<speaker1> Yes . I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off .
<speaker2> That's long leave . How's your project coming along ?
<speaker1> The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on .
<speaker2> Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave .
<speaker1> Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients .
<speaker2> Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed .
<speaker1> I will . Many thanks , Mr.Black .

<speaker1> Did you ever get a parking ticket ?
<speaker2> Only a few .
<speaker1> What's a few ?
<speaker2> I've gotten six , I think .
<speaker1> Did you pay your fines ?
<speaker2> Of course I have .
<speaker1> How much are the parking tickets ?
<speaker2> I think they're $ 130 .
<speaker1> That's expensive .
<speaker2> I just got a parking ticket .
<speaker1> You should probably pay the fine soon .
<speaker2> I'm going to pay it today .

<speaker1> Are you doing anything right now , Diana ?
<speaker2> I am typing a report for the moment , Mr . Robbins . Anything I need to do ?
<speaker1> Will you please cut it for a while and come in here to take a letter ?
<speaker2> Is it urgent ?
<speaker1> Yes , this letter can't go into the mail any later than 5 . It's about a contract .
<speaker2> Ok , I am coming .
<speaker1> Please take a seat , Diana . Have you got your spare pens and pencils ?
<speaker2> Yes , I have this time . But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can I ask you halfway ?
<speaker1> No , I ' d prefer not . I don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter .
<speaker2> All right . I understand now . Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments .
<speaker1> Of course , Diana . You'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it .
<speaker2> Certainly I will , Mr . Robbins . By the way , may I use a window envelope ?
<speaker1> Yes , that's fine . Now when you finish these , I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list .
<speaker2> You want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names ?
<speaker1> Right . And the last thing , we are going to clean the files out tomorrow . Now let's begin .

<speaker1> You're finally here ! What took so long ?
<speaker2> I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection .
<speaker1> It's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
<speaker2> I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest .
<speaker1> perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work .
<speaker2> I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good .
<speaker1> It would be better for the environment , too .
<speaker2> I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city .
<speaker1> Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well .
<speaker2> The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car .
<speaker1> Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides .
<speaker2> That's true . I could certainly use the exercise !
<speaker1> So , are you going to quit driving to work then ?
<speaker2> Yes , it's not good for me or for the environment .

<speaker1> That's really convenient . We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent , though .
<speaker2> I can take two thousand off . That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand .
<speaker1> That's great . Every little bit counts . And we don't need the parking space . I guess we could rent it out .
<speaker2> Sure , for at least three thousand per month .
<speaker1> That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for .
<speaker2> I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent .

<speaker1> Hello . I sent out my laundry yesterday.Aren ' t they ready ?
<speaker2> They'll be ready by this afternoon .
<speaker1> Oh , no ! I'm leaving for Japan at 11 this morning .
<speaker2> Is that right ? We're very sorry .
<speaker1> I thought it was " the same day " service.Anyway , please do hurry .
<speaker2> I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock .
<speaker1> Well , then , would you send it to Japan , please ?
<speaker2> Yes , we'll do so .

<speaker1> Hello , welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ?
<speaker2> I want to effect payment under an L / C today .
<speaker1> No problem . OK ... just checking for you . Ah , I'm afraid there aren't enough funds in your account to cover this transaction . What you can do is buy some US dollars , using local currency and we can credit your account with that amount .
<speaker2> That seems alright . What's the exchange rate like today ? Good or bad ?
<speaker1> It's not too bad today , actually . 828.23 .

<speaker1> How can I help you , sir ?
<speaker2> I am here to have a discussion on your company's investment issue .
<speaker1> Sorry , could you tell me your name ?
<speaker2> I am James Pond from FAM Company and I am here to discuss it with Nova .
<speaker1> Do you have an appointment ?
<speaker2> Yes , I did it yesterday . Our meeting should be 2 pm .
<speaker1> I guess she forgot your meeting . She is attending an important meeting in the company . Will you have a seat ? May I leave a memo for her ?
<speaker2> Thank you .
<speaker1> She will be back soon .

<speaker1> Excuse me . Would you please make a suit with this material ?
<speaker2> Sure . May I take your measurements ?
<speaker1> Please don't make it too tight . This is for autumn wear , so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath .
<speaker2> I see , sir . Can you come back for a fitting on the 10th , that's in a week's time ?
<speaker1> The 10th ? I'm sorry , but you see I'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th . Could you have the suit ready by the 8th , or at the latest , the 9th ?
<speaker2> Well , a business suit usually takes ten days ' time . But in your case , we'll try to have it ready sooner . How about coming for your fitting on the 8th ? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th ?
<speaker1> That's fine , thank you .

<speaker1> Good morning everyone . Thank you for attending the meeting today . I'm sure you all have a copy of the agenda . So let's get started with the first issue .
<speaker2> We're here today to present to you the results of our marketing research regarding the consumer behavior .
<speaker1> I would like to begin by introducing our foreign guests to our stuff on your left ( right ) , we have Mr . Brown , who is Vice President of Sales . Next to him is Ms . Arts , Director of Marketing for the Atlas Company . In the back row is Dr . Barolo , who is visiting from Italy . Thank you all for coming .
<speaker2> I am glad to see everyone is here and on time . Let's get started ! Susan , toss out some of your ideas .

<speaker1> It seems that many boys are fighting there .
<speaker2> Break it up ! I will not permit fighting in this campus .

<speaker1> the air quality in this city is horrendous ! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again !
<speaker2> exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment .
<speaker1> on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
<speaker2> as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health .
<speaker1> I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse
<speaker2> what is the greenhouse effect exactly ?
<speaker1> it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .
<speaker2> I see , so it's similar to global warming ?
<speaker1> they're related to one another , yes .
<speaker2> I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live .
<speaker1> people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .
<speaker2> people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .
<speaker1> I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place .

<speaker1> Would you like some cookies ? I just made them .
<speaker2> Thank you . Yes , I would .
<speaker1> These are chocolate , and those are almond-flavored .
<speaker2> I guess I'll try a chocolate one first.Mmmm ... this is delicious.Are they hard to make ?
<speaker1> No , they're really quite easy . Wait a minute , I've got the recipe right here.See ... these are the ingredients , and then you just follow the directions .
<speaker2> That does look easy . I think I'll make some tonight .

<speaker1> Can I help you ?
<speaker2> I'd like to buy a ticket to Casablanca on flight US125 tomorrow .
<speaker1> Hold on , plese.It will take off at 14:00 tomorrow.The price is $ 110 .
<speaker2> Well , I want to stay under $ 100 .
<speaker1> I am sorry Sir . We won't give any discount in busy seasons.The price is the same .

<speaker1> How do you use an ATM card , Billy ?
<speaker2> It
<speaker1> Ve got it written down here . Just a minute .
<speaker2> You really shouldn
<speaker1> Ve entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don
<speaker2> s right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money .
<speaker1> These machines aren

<speaker1> Hello , is Jennifer in ?
<speaker2> I am sorry , you have the wrong number .
<speaker1> Oh , I am really sorry .

<speaker1> Can you give me a hand with the dishes ?
<speaker2> Sure . Should I wash or dry ?
<speaker1> I wash and you'll dry .
<speaker2> OK . Let's do it .

<speaker1> Excuse me , do you have the latest issue of Newsworld ?
<speaker2> Yes , this week's issue just came in . Here it is .
<speaker1> How about Music Madness ?
<speaker2> Let me check ... yes , we got the October issue a few days ago . It's on that shelf over there .
<speaker1> Okay , I'll take these two magazines and a copy of Today's Post .

<speaker1> Good afternoon , Miss . What can I do for you ?
<speaker2> Could you tell me my account balance ? My account number is ...
<speaker1> Just a moment , please . Your name ?
<speaker2> Emily Smith .
<speaker1> Here is your balance .
<speaker2> Thank you . I want to make a withdrawal of 150 dollars .
<speaker1> Here you go , Miss .
<speaker2> Thank you .

<speaker1> We will go to Luoyang for a vacation next month .
<speaker2> How long will you stay there ?
<speaker1> About one week .
<speaker2> Where will you live during the vacation .
<speaker1> In the hotel .
<speaker2> Have you made a reservation ?
<speaker1> Yes , we have .
<speaker2> That's OK .

<speaker1> You look great ! How do you stay in such good shape ?
<speaker2> Well , I go jogging every morning , eat a healthful diet and work out in a gymnasium twice a week .
<speaker1> Wow , it sounds like a lot of work . I guess I'm too lazy to do all that .

<speaker1> Bob from accounting is on the line . Do you want to speak with him ?
<speaker2> Yes , I need to talk to him .
<speaker1> I'll put the call through then .
<speaker2> Thank you .

<speaker1> I want to send some money to Australia . Could you handle it for me ?
<speaker2> Yes , madam , how much would you like to remit ?
<speaker1> 2,000 AD $ .
<speaker2> Which would you like to remit , by mail or by cable ?
<speaker1> What is the difference between them ?
<speaker2> The cable will take less time for your account , in the meantime , the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one .
<speaker1> Well , I think the cable is better .
<speaker2> OK , please fill in the application form giving the name and address of beneficiary , your name and telephone .
<speaker1> All right . Here you are .
<speaker2> Everything is OK . The commission is 50 yuan .
<speaker1> Here you are . Thanks a lot .

<speaker1> Kate , can we change the channel ?
<speaker2> Why ?
<speaker1> This channel has so many advertisements , and it doesn't have any good TV programs .
<speaker2> OK . You can change it .
<speaker1> What about this one ? Do you like this program ?
<speaker2> No , I think it is very boring . Can you change it to Channel Twelve , please ?
<speaker1> Yes . Oh , it's a talk show .
<speaker2> Yeah , it's very funny . Have you ever watched it before ?
<speaker1> No , I haven't . This is my first time to watch it .
<speaker2> I'm sure you will like it .

<speaker1> Excuse me , is there any summer resort around the town ?
<speaker2> As far as I know , the nearest one is next to the Willdon .
<speaker1> It doesn't matter . I just want to have a relax and I don't care how far it is . Can you tell me how to get there ?
<speaker2> Yes , take the greyhound bus . It will lead you directly there .
<speaker1> Thanks a billion .

<speaker1> Every honored guests , welcome to Hang Thou . Now we are visiting Tiger-running Spring .
<speaker2> How can we relate tiger to this spot , Miss Zhang ?
<speaker1> Its name originates from a legend that two tigers run here and made a hole , and then a spring gushed out from it .
<speaker2> How ignorant I am !
<speaker1> The Longing Tea and the Tiger-running Spring water are always considered as the “ Two Wonders in West Lake . ”
<speaker2> I know that tea . It smells fragrant .
<speaker1> That's right . All my guests , attention please . We will have half an hour to visit the spring and take photos . And next spot will be the Moon Reflected in Three Pools .
<speaker2> Janice , David , come here . We take some photos here . I can't imagine how beautiful it is !

<speaker1> Can I give you a hand ?
<speaker2> Thanks .

<speaker1> You have been staying at home for several days . Would you like to hang out with me ?
<speaker2> No problem . Wait a moment .

<speaker1> May I speak to Mr . Baker ?
<speaker2> I ' m afraid he's not in .
<speaker1> Will you ask him to call me collect when he
<speaker2> s calling , please ?
<speaker1> Yes , this is Cindy Wang of A & B Trading Company in New York .

<speaker1> I'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too title .
<speaker2> I'm not sure I can't agree , dan
<speaker1> Why not ?
<speaker2> Surely , there are other ways to save money .
<speaker1> What are you talking about , we tried everything !

<speaker1> I've got some great news for you !
<speaker2> Did you get the position you wanted ?
<speaker1> Yes , I'll be promoted to department manager .
<speaker2> I'm glad to hear that . Congratulations !
<speaker1> Thank you . Actually , I could not believe it at first . You know , there're so many outstanding people in our company . Many of them are qualified to fill that position .
<speaker2> Sure , but you really did great and outperformed the others . You deserved it !
<speaker1> Thank you very much .

<speaker1> Thank you for a lovely day . I really enjoyed it .
<speaker2> It was nice to have you with us .

<speaker2> Yes , madam . May I help you ?
<speaker1> Yes . I

<speaker1> it's a lovely day out today , isn't it ?
<speaker2> it's beautiful . Enjoy it while it lasts . It's supposed to get cold tomorrow .
<speaker1> what's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
<speaker2> it's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there's a chance of freezing rain .
<speaker1> that doesn't sound pretty .
<speaker2> do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
<speaker1> well , I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends .
<speaker2> you might want to change your plans . With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery .
<speaker1> I suppose I should . I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . Do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
<speaker2> I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
<speaker1> if you're lucky , it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day !
<speaker2> if that happens , then I'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .
<speaker1> that sounds like fun .
<speaker2> hey , look outside ! It's started to drizzle !
<speaker1> English weather is even more predictable than I had previously thought .

<speaker1> Can you tell me what's included in your warranty ?
<speaker2> Certainly . The product has a two-year guarantee . If it breaks down during that period we offer a replacement unit completely free of charge . Our products are very reliable but we recommend you take out an extended warranty . This covers you for a further two years .
<speaker1> I see . What does that include ?
<speaker2> It covers all parts and labour , except for normal wear and tear of course .
<speaker1> What sort of response time do you guarantee ?
<speaker2> Our engineers are on call 24 hours a day . We guarantee someone will be with you within four hours , but in practice it's often much sooner .
<speaker1> Are there any exclusions ?
<speaker2> Not really . It's a very comprehensive warranty . I ' ll put a copy in the post to you and you can read through the small print .

<speaker1> Do you have any particular conditions that you would like our company to take into consideration ?
<speaker2> No , nothing in particular .
<speaker1> All right . If we decide to hire you , we'd pay you two thousand and five hundred yuan a month at the start . You can have Saturdays and Sundays off . Besides , you may have a paid month holiday every year . How do you think about it ?
<speaker2> As regards salary , I leave it to you to decide after experience of capacity .
<speaker1> Well , we'll give you our decision in a couple of days . It's a pleasure to talk to you , Mr . Liu .
<speaker2> Thank you , Mr . White . I really appreciate your assistance .

<speaker1> Did you ever buy food from the snack stands near our hotel ?
<speaker2> Yes , several times .
<speaker1> How do you like them ?
<speaker2> Not bad .
<speaker1> I always have the temptation to eat something there .
<speaker2> Then , why didn't you do that ?
<speaker1> I don't know how much we can trust them . Do you have any ideas ?
<speaker2> Some of them , I think , are not good .
<speaker1> It doesn't taste good ?
<speaker2> No , I mean some of them are not clean enough .
<speaker1> That's my greatest concern . But how can you tell which one is clean ?
<speaker2> I judge by appearances .
<speaker1> I got it . I think it's worth trying .
<speaker2> It certainly is .
<speaker1> I'd like to try some kebab , roasted squid , and many different appealing things .
<speaker2> Don't try everything at one time , please .
<speaker1> I see . Thank you .

<speaker1> I need my minibar restocked .
<speaker2> Everything is gone , sir ?
<speaker1> There's not a drop left of anything .
<speaker2> Is there anything in particular you want ?
<speaker1> Yes , the Perrier and the Jim Beam hit the spot . Let me have three more of each .
<speaker2> Got it . Anything else ?
<speaker1> I really liked the apples . Bring me a couple of apples , please .
<speaker2> Not a problem . Anything else ?
<speaker1> Oh , yes , one more thing
<speaker2> Someone will be up shortly with your order , sir .

<speaker1> I will travel to Southeast Asia this summer , so I need to exchange some US dollars . Can I get the foreign currency at any bank ?
<speaker2> I don't think you can . In China , our currency is not freely convertible yet .
<speaker1> Do you mean there is no way to get any foreign money ?
<speaker2> No . You can go to the Bank of China to exchange some US dollars at the current exchange rate of the day you exchange them . The maximum amount you can exchange is $ 2,000 .
<speaker1> Only $ 2,000 ? Are there any other ways to get the money exchanged ?
<speaker2> The only official way is to go to Bank of China .
<speaker1> I'd better take more dollars with me . It seems that I need to borrow some from my friends .

<speaker1> can you squeeze me in sometime today ?
<speaker2> That
<speaker1> re saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy .
<speaker2> Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? It won

<speaker1> You seem to be upset . What
<speaker2> s because of my son . Dick keeps getting on my nerves
<speaker1> Dick ? How come ? He used to be as meek as a lamb .
<speaker2> Yes , he used to be . But now he
<speaker1> t be off the beans .

<speaker1> Bring me some toast , please .
<speaker2> Would you like butter or jam on your toast or do you just want it plain ?
<speaker1> Spread some jam , please .
<speaker2> Anything to drink ?
<speaker1> Black coffee is fine .

<speaker1> Peter , it's time to get up .
<speaker2> Ten more minutes , mom .
<speaker1> What time is it now ?

<speaker1> thanks for flattering me 。 i think you dance much right ?
<speaker2> no , just occasionally
<speaker1> oh , i like this music very much , let's tango .
<speaker2> i'm afraid i can't dance well .

<speaker1> Well , it's illegal to bring food and drinks into the theater .
<speaker2> Too bad . I did anyway .
<speaker1> No wonder you brought such a big bag today .
<speaker2> I brought Strawberry Sticks . See ?
<speaker1> Those are the ones that are pre-dipped in sweet coating !
<speaker2> Yep . And there's real strawberry chunks in the coating .

<speaker1> I think that you look very cute today .
<speaker2> Is that right ? This is a brand new outfit .
<speaker1> What store did you get it from ?
<speaker2> I went to Macy's and picked it out .
<speaker1> I love your outfit right now .
<speaker2> Well , I think you look nice today too .

<speaker2> I think that those are some really nice shoes . What kind are they ?
<speaker1> These are Chucks .
<speaker2> Your shoes look really nice . How much did you get them for ?
<speaker1> They only cost me about forty dollars .
<speaker2> I'm going to go get a pair for myself .

<speaker1> What can I do for you ?
<speaker2> I'd like to be waken up tomorrow morning .
<speaker1> OK sir . At what time ?
<speaker2> Well , how long is it from here to the train station ?

<speaker2> Ok , where can I find their telephone number ?
<speaker1> They are all listed here on this sheet of paper .

<speaker1> Unless it
<speaker2> s their home numbers .
<speaker1> Alright . What if I can

<speaker2> I know . Sorry , I shouldn't have rushed you , but I just couldn't stay at home and wait .
<speaker1> Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ?
<speaker2> Why not ? I'd love to do that .

<speaker1> The environment varies greatly because of difference in language , customs and traditions .
<speaker2> Yes . This gap can be filled by export market research before exporting .
<speaker1> But the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers .
<speaker2> That's right . They do not appreciate its value and consider it to be a luxury .
<speaker1> Therefore , when enterprises are spending a lot of money in trying to penetrate a new market , they should research whether their products can be sold at high enough a price and in a satisfactory amount .
<speaker2> Exactly !

<speaker1> I plan to take the loan for 3 years .
<speaker2> Well , the yearly interest rate is 5.49 % for 3 years . I'm sure you are qualified to apply for this loan .

<speaker1> d recommend insects . You can get them from your garden , but remember that lizards eat a lot insects . I sell them here .

<speaker1> Yes , I do . I like traveling very much .
<speaker2> Are you willing to work for extra hours ?

<speaker2> It will be held on October 15th .
<speaker1> Should I arrive early or on time ?
<speaker2> You'd better be early in case that you may be late because of traffic jam . That will put you in a insurmountable place .

<speaker1> How do you like your overcoat , sir ?
<speaker2> It's a bit too large . Would you please shorten the sleeves ?
<speaker1> OK , no problem . Let me take your measurement .

<speaker2> Well . We only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable L \\ C , payable against shipping documents .

<speaker1> Dad , I
<speaker2> m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg .
<speaker1> I don
<speaker2> t know if you
<speaker1> s just too much instability . I wouldn
<speaker2> m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns .

Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .

<speaker2> Em , it's delicious !
<speaker1> Thank you ! My wife likes cooking very much .
<speaker2> You're lucky .

<speaker2> Yes , to tell you the truth . I am on a diet .

<speaker1> How about your grades of study ?
<speaker2> I had been doing quite well . In all subjects , I got excellent scores .

<speaker2> Certainly , sir . What would you like done to them ?
<speaker1> They're a little bit too long , so I'd like about half an inch taken off them .

<speaker2> Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion .
<speaker1> I didn

<speaker1> Do you think we should travel by bus or by train ?
<speaker2> It's a difficult choice.The train is a little faster , but much more expensive .
<speaker1> We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams .
<speaker2> Buses are more cramps and you can't walk around .
<speaker1> That's true.But I feel that I see more when I travel by bus .
<speaker2> Really ? I think you see more traveling by train .
<speaker1> So which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
<speaker2> I prefer going by train , even though it costs more .
<speaker1> Ok , then we'll go by train . I'm sure we'll have a good journey.Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ?
<speaker2> The trains aren't usually full.We can get them on the day we travel.We should buy return tickets , because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles .
<speaker1> We should take a packed lunch on the journey.The food they sell on the trains is always expensive .

<speaker1> Did you hear about Lulu ?
<speaker2> No , what ?
<speaker1> She and Vic broke up and now she
<speaker2> t even know they were dating !

<speaker1> yes , breakfast is included and parking is available .
<speaker2> fantastic . Thank you very much .
<speaker1> you're welcome . And we have 24 hour reception . Please don't hesitate to call anytime if you have any further questions .

<speaker1> I have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . I feel exhausted .
<speaker2> You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard .
<speaker1> You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn
<speaker2> s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation .

<speaker1> What sort of shopping is nearby , Mr . Taylor ?
<speaker2> Call me John . This is a great area of the city for shopping . There
<speaker1> s a really nice neighborhood .

<speaker1> Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it .
<speaker2> Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know.Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more .
<speaker1> But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished .
<speaker2> But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely .
<speaker1> Well , only you liked it really , darling .
<speaker2> Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy .

<speaker1> Hi , Bob , everything okay ?
<speaker2> More or less . There's just one thing bothering me .
<speaker1> Oh ? What's that ?
<speaker2> Well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
<speaker1> What gift ?
<speaker2> It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it .
<speaker1> You refused the gift ? That's terrible .
<speaker2> I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way .
<speaker1> Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
<speaker2> That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .

<speaker1> I've been looking for a swimming pool , but I haven't found one yet .
<speaker2> We have no pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in our gym .
<speaker1> Swim stations ? Could you be a little more explicit ?
<speaker2> You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere ? Well , it's the same thing .
<speaker1> Gee , that's a great idea . Now , how much do I have to pay ?
<speaker2> The stations are absolutely free to guests , sir .
<speaker1> Great ! Now , when can I go down there and use the stations ?
<speaker2> The swim stations are open daily from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m .
<speaker1> Boy , oh boy ! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks .
<speaker2> Be warned , sir . At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded .

<speaker1> Hi . Today , I am the interviewer for your visa application .
<speaker2> OK . Here is my application form and all the documents .
<speaker1> Can you tell me why do you want a visa to America ?
<speaker2> Because I want to have a view of the exotic landscapes to extend my views and understanding of the world .
<speaker1> OK . Do you plan to go to America all by yourself or with your family ?
<speaker2> Myself .
<speaker1> Have you finished all you preparation ?
<speaker2> Yes . Everything is ready .

<speaker1> What a pity you are leaving so soon . I wish you could stay a few more days . Sir , can you deliver a speech for us ?

<speaker2> Madam , we also welcome you to visit our company . I hope you can also bring your family there to have a look of our company . In this way , we will know each other better .
<speaker1> Definitely ! Thank you !

<speaker1> What are your salary expectations now ?
<speaker2> I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 120,000 Yuan per year .
<speaker1> That's a little more than we had planned .
<speaker2> I think you'll find I'm worth that .
<speaker1> I can only offer you 110,000 Yuan a year . Raises will be given after a three-month probation according to your performance . Is that satisfactory ?
<speaker2> Yes , it is quite reasonable .

<speaker2> Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .
<speaker1> O . K . , O . K . , I

<speaker1> Sally , you look so corporate ! What interview do you have today ?
<speaker2> Amalgamated Trading Company . It's Swiss . Don't you think working at a foreign company would be glamorous ?
<speaker1> Yeah , I guess so . I've never actually heard of this one , but ...
<speaker2> Well , it's small , but it's a young , dynamic , rapidly-growing company with a progressive , humanistic philosophy .
<speaker1> You didn't read their brochure or anything , did you ?
<speaker2> Four times . I'm totally prepared . Oh , no ! I forgot to take off my nail polish ! And I have to be there in 15 minutes ! That's it . I blew it .
<speaker1> Well , they are progressive and humanistic-maybe they don't care about nail polish ... uh ... even blue nail polish . Just keep your confidence up and you'll do great .
<speaker2> But the competition is fierce this year ... and it seems like I'm the only one left who hasn't found a job .
<speaker1> Not quite the only one . I really wanted that job at the magazine , but I still haven't heard from them .

<speaker1> I'm calling to tell you that the merchandise ordered last month has not arrived yet .
<speaker2> I'm sorry , hold on a moment . I'll check it out . But we have already shipped it to you last month . Would you like us to contact the express company to know what's going on ?
<speaker1> Please find out the reason as soon as possible . We are in bad need of it .
<speaker2> Ok , I am terribly sorry for the trouble you are getting into.We will contact you first thing , once we know the reason .

<speaker1> I really want to make something for dinner .
<speaker2> What are you going to cook ?
<speaker1> I haven't the slightest clue what I'm going to make .
<speaker2> A teriyaki bowl sounds nice .
<speaker1> I don't know how to make that .
<speaker2> All you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef .
<speaker1> That sounds fairly simple , but how do I cook it ?
<speaker2> The first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice .
<speaker1> What's next ?
<speaker2> Then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it .
<speaker1> What's the next thing I need to do ?
<speaker2> Then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy .

<speaker1> How do I submit an expense report ?
<speaker2> You need all your receipts for reimbursement .
<speaker1> You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ?
<speaker2> Yes , here is the form for an expense report . Fill it out and give it to me . I

<speaker1> Good morning !
<speaker2> Can I speak to Miss Cooper please ?
<speaker1> Would you hold on a second , please ? Miss Cooper's extension is engaged .
<speaker2> Engaged . Oh , dear ! Could you tell her it's a long-distance call ?
<speaker1> I'm sorry , sir . I can't interrupt her . I'm sure she won't be very long .
<speaker2> How long do you think she'll be ?
<speaker1> I really can't say how long she'll be .
<speaker2> Can I leave a message , please ?
<speaker1> Yes , certainly .
<speaker2> Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her ?
<speaker1> Yes , sir . I'll ring her on an inside line if you like .
<speaker2> Thank you very much .

<speaker1> Excuse me , waiter , would you please bring us a nest ? A friend of mine will join us .
<speaker2> Wait a moment . Here you are .
<speaker1> By the way , we would like to order some dishes for my friend .
<speaker2> Sure .

<speaker1> Can you help me out , Chuck ?
<speaker2> Sure . What's it , Yvonne ?
<speaker1> I want to put my desk over there , but it's too heavy for me to move .
<speaker2> Okay , you take one end and I'll take the other .

<speaker1> Good morning . Madam . What can I do for you today ?
<speaker2> Hello . I hope you can help me ; I'm a little worried about my new card .
<speaker1> What seems to be the problem ?
<speaker2> I received my new card this morning , but I'm unable to use it .
<speaker1> Oh ? You mean , the ATM machine has eaten it ?
<speaker2> No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it !
<speaker1> You said you received your card this morning , am I right ?
<speaker2> Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ?
<speaker1> Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons .
<speaker2> Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me .

<speaker1> Can you manage chopsticks ?
<speaker2> Why not ? See .
<speaker1> Good mastery . How do you like our Chinese food ?
<speaker2> Oh , great ! It's delicious . You see , I am already putting on weight . There is one thing I don't like however , MSG .
<speaker1> What's wrong with MSG ? It helps to bring out the taste of the food .
<speaker2> According to some studies it may cause cancer .
<speaker1> Oh , don't let that worry you . If that were true , China wouldn't have such a large population .
<speaker2> I just happen to have a question for you guys . Why do the Chinese cook the vegetables ? You see what I mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated .
<speaker1> I don't know exactly . It's a tradition . Maybe it's for sanitary reasons .

<speaker1> Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ?
<speaker2> It was a nightmare .
<speaker1> What

<speaker1> Do you have any seat preferences , sir ?
<speaker2> Yes , could you put me in the no-smoking section ?
<speaker1> Yes . Would you like a window seat ?
<speaker2> If one's available , please . But not over the wing .

<speaker1> morning . Rent-A-Car Agency . May I help you ?
<speaker2> Good morning . This is Paul Alexander calling from the Isis Advertising Firm . We need a car to the airport for Mr . Phillips .
<speaker1> Certainly , Mr . Alexander . When would Mr . Phillips like to leave ?
<speaker2> Let me check ... His flight

<speaker1> I'm calling today about a bill that I never received .
<speaker2> Can you tell me which credit card it was for ?
<speaker1> It was for my Master Card .
<speaker2> You should've gotten that bill two weeks ago .
<speaker1> I haven't got it in the mail yet .
<speaker2> The computer is showing that all bills have been mailed .
<speaker1> What am I supposed to do about my bill then ?
<speaker2> Maybe you should call your post office .
<speaker1> But if it's their mistake , can I get an extension on my bill payment ?
<speaker2> Yes , but you will need to send us proof of their mistake .
<speaker1> Okay , thank you very much for your help .
<speaker2> Not a problem . Enjoy the rest of your day .

<speaker1> Jenny , don't you think it's really charming ?
<speaker2> Yes . It's a feast of eyes to walking in the museum .
<speaker1> Let's take our time and enjoy the art and sprite of the famous museum .
<speaker2> What a shame that we can't take pictures .

<speaker1> OK , Allen . It's your turn . Are you ready ?
<speaker2> I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ?
<speaker1> Come on ! In the two hours we've been here you haven't sung even one song !
<speaker2> I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night .
<speaker1> Well , you asked for it . Why don\
<speaker2> The King .
<speaker1> " I

<speaker1> Here is the document you asked for this morning .
<speaker2> Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks .
<speaker1> You
<speaker2> t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do .

<speaker1> How are you doing , Jim ?
<speaker2> Fine , just fine.How about you ?
<speaker1> Not too bad .

<speaker1> I think your presentation impressed the client , Daniel . You did a good job .
<speaker2> Thank you , Mr . Cooper . I hope we get the contract .

<speaker1> What's for lunch ?
<speaker2> Pork chops .

<speaker1> What happened to you ?
<speaker2> I think I caught a cold .
<speaker1> Do you have any symptoms ?
<speaker2> Runny nose and coughing .
<speaker1> Do you have a fever ?
<speaker2> I have just taken the temperature , I don't think so .
<speaker1> It's not serious .
<speaker2> Are you sure ?
<speaker1> Yes .
<speaker2> What should I do ?
<speaker1> You should drink more hot water , and do some exercise .

<speaker1> What kind of place shall we rent ?
<speaker2> It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .
<speaker1> Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .
<speaker2> Neither am I . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area .
<speaker1> I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
<speaker2> Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
<speaker1> Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
<speaker2> How much do you think the rent will be ?
<speaker1> I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .

<speaker1> I don't think we can meet the delivery date you suggest . It's too soon .
<speaker2> Well , is it possible for you to effect shipment by the middle of June ?
<speaker1> The earliest we can do is by the end of June .

<speaker1> Did you have any working experience during college ?
<speaker2> Yes , I did some part-time jobs such as English tutor , salesman , and model .
<speaker1> What did you learn from your part-time jobs ?
<speaker2> I learned to be patient , professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .

<speaker1> Smells good ! What
<speaker2> ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
<speaker1> Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don

<speaker1> Can you tell me if there is a flight to New York ?
<speaker2> Yes . Flight DB117 departs at 5:38 pm and arrives in New York at 6:00 am with a layover in Chicago . It also makes a refueling stop at Colombia .
<speaker1> So many stops ! Don't you have any direct flights ?
<speaker2> Sorry sir , it is the only flight wa have right now .

<speaker1> Hello.Hot water overflowed from the bathtub.Will you help me ?
<speaker2> Would you turn off the tap ?
<speaker1> I did it .
<speaker2> Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door ?
<speaker1> OK . I will .
<speaker2> I'll have our housekeeper come right away .
<speaker1> I'm sorry I was too tired to fall asleep .
<speaker2> When you woke up , the water was coming out of the tub .
<speaker1> Right.Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ?

<speaker1> Would you like some more coffee ?
<speaker2> No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill .
<speaker1> The waitress is bringing the bill right now .
<speaker2> This waitress has really been on top of things , hasn't she ?
<speaker1> Yes , this waitress did a great job .
<speaker2> OK , let's see what the damage is . The total for our meal is $ 36.00 .
<speaker1> What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ?
<speaker2> Fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . What do you think about 20 % this time ?
<speaker1> Yes , 20 % would be perfect .
<speaker2> Her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00 . The total will be $ 43.20 .
<speaker1> Yes , that was one fantastic meal !
<speaker2> I agree . Maybe we can come back again next week .

<speaker1> It
<speaker2> d rather you stayed in the office and did these things .
<speaker1> Do you want to type that letter ?
<speaker2> I
<speaker1> d rather you told her .

<speaker1> Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head .
<speaker2> What crime did I commit ?
<speaker1> You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs , so we are taking you into custody . We ' Ve found some heroin in your house . You have the following rights while you are being interviewed . You have the right to remain silent . You don't have to make any statement against your will . You have the right to defense counsel . You have the right to request an investigation of evidence favorable to your case . Do you understand your rights ?
<speaker2> I am innocent .

<speaker1> Would you like to come by and play bridge ?
<speaker2> Well , let's see . Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time .
<speaker1> Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired .
<speaker2> Hmm . Well , in that case , we could go to the movies .
<speaker1> Oh , we always go to the movies . Can't we do something different ?
<speaker2> Well , do you have any suggestions ?
<speaker1> Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ?
<speaker2> It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things .
<speaker1> Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
<speaker2> OK .
<speaker1> Hello , Janet . It's me ... Oh , fine . Just fine . Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ?

<speaker1> Tom , it's time for you to go to bed .
<speaker2> Good night , mum .
<speaker1> Good night .

<speaker1> Operator . May I help you ?
<speaker2> Yes . How do I get an outside line , please ?
<speaker1> Just dial 0 , wait for the dial tone , and then dial the phone number you want to call . Or we can place a call for you , if you want .
<speaker2> No , thanks a lot . I'll try it myself .

<speaker1> What's our target audience for this campaign ?
<speaker2> This go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two .
<speaker1> Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ?
<speaker2> Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here .
<speaker1> Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ?
<speaker2> Demographics say an average age of 28.7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year .

<speaker1> John , I'd like to see you in my office for a minute .
<speaker2> Yes , sir , I'll be there in just a moment .
<speaker1> John , I have been watching you . I've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and I'm impressed . You've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts . I just want to let you to know , after this month's performance reviews , I'm recommending you for promotion .
<speaker2> Gosh sir , thank you , sir ! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department .
<speaker1> Well , it's not going to be in our department . I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . There's supervisory spot opening up in financial . I'm turning your name in for it .
<speaker2> Management ? Wow , I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff .
<speaker1> You've earned it .

<speaker1> How can I help you today ?
<speaker2> I am returning something that I bought yesterday .
<speaker1> What would you like to return ?
<speaker2> I'm returning a cellphone .
<speaker1> Was there something wrong with it ?
<speaker2> It's defective .
<speaker1> What isn't working on it ?
<speaker2> It keeps turning off on it's own .
<speaker1> Alright , do you have the receipt ?
<speaker2> I have it right here .
<speaker1> I'm going to take care of this and refund your money .
<speaker2> Thanks for your help .

<speaker1> I miss grandma . I dreamed about her yesterday .
<speaker2> Dear , let

<speaker1> Good morning , sir . Can I help you ?
<speaker2> Good morning . I'd like to cash this check .
<speaker1> Yes , sir . Can you show you identity ?
<speaker2> What about the driving license ?
<speaker1> Don't you have any other identification ?
<speaker2> I am sorry . I only have my driving license with me .
<speaker1> Ok . Would you please sign your name on the back of the check ?
<speaker2> Thank you . Here you are .
<speaker1> How do you want your money ?
<speaker2> Would you give me some in twenties and tens ?
<speaker1> All right . Please wait for a moment .

<speaker1> Could you fill in this form , please ?
<speaker2> All right .
<speaker1> Have you got any identification ?
<speaker2> Yes , here's my ID card .

<speaker1> Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !
<speaker2> What ? What did you buy ?
<speaker1> It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !
<speaker2> What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?
<speaker1> There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick .
<speaker2> And ?
<speaker1> So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .
<speaker2> And it's a brick ?
<speaker1> Yes .
<speaker2> I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?
<speaker1> I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .
<speaker2> So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .
<speaker1> Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .
<speaker2> But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?
<speaker1> He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .
<speaker2> Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !
<speaker1> C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .
<speaker2> That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .
<speaker1> You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?

<speaker1> Hello , Arthur . What seems to be the problem ?
<speaker2> Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I
<speaker1> t quite make out the other symbol but I think it
<speaker2> re as blind as a bat !
<speaker1> Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times .
<speaker2> Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription .
<speaker1> Thanks doc !
<speaker2> Arthur , that

<speaker1> Would you like some more coffee ?
<speaker2> No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill .
<speaker1> Good luck finding the waitress !
<speaker2> The service this evening has kind of sucked . Is that our server over there ?
<speaker1> I'll go get the check , since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way .
<speaker2> Good . I'll just stay here until you get back .
<speaker1> So the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner .
<speaker2> How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ?
<speaker1> I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service .
<speaker2> I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight .
<speaker1> I think that we should leave 10 % .
<speaker2> $ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip .

<speaker1> I want to fly to Congo on Monday , the 17th .
<speaker2> Let me see what's available .
<speaker1> By the way , I'd prefer a night flight .
<speaker2> Africa Airline 551 leaves at 9:00 pm .
<speaker1> That's fine . I want to pay in cash . Here is the money .

<speaker1> How much was your watch ?
<speaker2> Take a guess .

<speaker1> A guy in my office got the flu the other day . Today I seem to have come down with it , too .
<speaker2> Very likely . You have a slight fever . Do you have a headache , too ?
<speaker1> Yes . I wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon , because I'll be on a business trip in two days .
<speaker2> Well , you have to let your flu run its course . You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery .
<speaker1> But I'm going on a business trip in two days !
<speaker2> Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it . If you go out while you are sick , it won't help you recover . You may even pass your disease on to others .

<speaker1> Would you care for a drink ?
<speaker2> No , thanks . I'm fine .

<speaker1> Let's go practice your driving .
<speaker2> If that's what you want to do , then we can .
<speaker1> Did you buckle your seatbelt ?
<speaker2> I'm buckled up . What's next ?
<speaker1> You need to start the car now .
<speaker2> What do you want me to do ?
<speaker1> Go left .
<speaker2> How far should I go ?
<speaker1> I'll let you know when I want you to stop .
<speaker2> Tell me before you want me to stop .
<speaker1> All right , try parking here .
<speaker2> Thanks . Let's go driving again tomorrow .

<speaker1> How may I help you ?
<speaker2> I

<speaker1> I'd like to extend my visa for another two years .
<speaker2> Are you on a tourist visa or a student visa ?
<speaker1> Student visa .
<speaker2> What is the reason for extension ?
<speaker1> I'll go into a practical training as soon as I receive my Master ' s degree from the University of Pennsylvania early next month .
<speaker2> We

<speaker1> Do you like the apartment ?
<speaker2> I absolutely love the apartment .
<speaker1> Everything is okay ?
<speaker2> I do have one problem with the apartment .
<speaker1> What
<speaker2> t like all those stains in the carpet .
<speaker1> We will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment .
<speaker2> I did not know that .
<speaker1> I assure you that we will , and if there are any more problems , feel free to tell me .
<speaker2> That was the only thing that I saw wrong with the apartment .
<speaker1> I
<speaker2> s absolutely incredible . I

<speaker1> Come in , Arnold . Have a seat .
<speaker2> Good morning .
<speaker1> Would you like something to drink ?
<speaker2> No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk .
<speaker1> So , you're a serious coffee drinker .
<speaker2> Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted .
<speaker1> Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing.Everyone has to have something.For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ?
<speaker2> No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker .
<speaker1> Well , what would you like to talk to me about ?
<speaker2> I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal .
<speaker1> I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it .
<speaker2> It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday .
<speaker1> Yes .
<speaker2> Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here .
<speaker1> What do you suggest ?
<speaker2> The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation .
<speaker1> You mean because people have to go across town to get here .
<speaker2> Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road .
<speaker1> That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them .
<speaker2> I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them .
<speaker1> I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that .
<speaker2> Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more .
<speaker1> Well .
<speaker2> I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that .
<speaker1> You mean you want to run the meetings ?
<speaker2> No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better .
<speaker1> Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks .
<speaker2> I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized .
<speaker1> I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works .
<speaker2> Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it .
<speaker1> I will call the managers.Then tomorrow I\
<speaker2> new style .

<speaker1> You got lost . You're kidding !
<speaker2> No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost .
<speaker1> You could have called .
<speaker2> I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were .
<speaker1> You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ?
<speaker2> Guess where we ended up .
<speaker1> I don't know . Where ?
<speaker2> When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield .
<speaker1> Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ?
<speaker2> I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .
<speaker1> Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
<speaker2> I know it is . I don't know how it happened .
<speaker1> Hmm , maybe I do .
<speaker2> What ?
<speaker1> Maybe I have an idea how it happened .
<speaker2> How ?
<speaker1> You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road .
<speaker2> Oh , that's what you think , huh ?

<speaker1> Won't you have some of this ?
<speaker2> Yes , thanks .
<speaker1> It's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue .

<speaker1> I'm glad you like it .
<speaker2> You Americans usually have nutritious food .
<speaker1> Oh , but Chinese food is so delicious . I wish I knew how to cook Chinese food . Do you follow recipes ?
<speaker2> We use different spices but few people use recipes . They learn to cook by experience .
<speaker1> I always use a recipe but my grandmother never did . She was a great cook . She would make clam chowder and cornbread every Sunday night .

<speaker1> I like these shoes .

<speaker2> Honey , you can ask him to be quite . Otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ?
<speaker1> Alright . Maybe it's the only way to do it .

<speaker1> Come in and sit down , Jack . Now , what's the trouble ?
<speaker2> I've got a terrible pain in my stomach , Doctor .

<speaker1> Three times a day after meals .
<speaker2> Thank you , Doctor.Goodbye .

<speaker1> Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ?
<speaker2> Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it .
<speaker1> Totally agree . What is your solution ?
<speaker2> Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy .
<speaker1> You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
<speaker2> It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .

<speaker2> It's a quarter past three .

<speaker1> I would like to buy some local handcrafts as gifts to my friends and relatives .

<speaker1> Doctor , save my baby , please
<speaker2> What symptoms does he have ?
<speaker1> He has had a fever for one day . Just now at home , he had febrile convulsions with teeth and fists clenched and eyes turned up . We were at a loss what to do . We called an ambulance and brought the baby here .
<speaker2> How long did the convulsion last ?
<speaker1> About 3 minutes .
<speaker2> Does he have any other complaints ?
<speaker1> Three days ago , he began to cough , sneeze and have a running nose . Yesterday , he began to have a fever .
<speaker2> Have you taken his temperature ?
<speaker1> It was 38 ° C this morning and it was 39 ° C just now .
<speaker2> Let me examine him to see if there is any rash . No rash .
<speaker1> Is it serious ? Is it meningitis ?
<speaker2> No , it is not meningitis . Just a high fever and convulsions , which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection .
<speaker1> Does he have to be admitted to hospital ?
<speaker2> No . No need for admission . I'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first . Then I will give you a prescription . The pink tablets are used for his fever . When his temperature is over 38 ° C , give him one tablet . The other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions . The white liquid is for the cold . Give the baby plenty of water to drink .
<speaker1> Thank you very much , doctor .

<speaker2> I always love skiing . You know , it's a cool game for cool people . Stay with me and you will be cool , too .
<speaker1> Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look .
<speaker2> Sure . It's probably the skiing show . Adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
<speaker1> See that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .
<speaker2> Hey , don't be so pathetic . It's a maximal sports show . What else can they do to attract more visitors ? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
<speaker1> You are right . But what if the avalanche happened ?
<speaker2> They are all very experienced and great skiers . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
<speaker1> Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow in here ?
<speaker2> Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ?
<speaker1> Hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist .
<speaker2> Sorry . Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .
<speaker1> Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
<speaker2> It's possible . But the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
<speaker1> It's a good thing . OK , let's go skiing .
<speaker2> Here we go .

<speaker1> Now people are talking about world recession which started more than a year ago . Can you give us your personal assessment of the situation of the global economy ?
<speaker2> As you know , we are in a very special time . This is a very hard time for many countries ' economics , both developed and developing . I think the current economic situation could be described as synchronized slowdown of major economies .
<speaker1> What is the direct impact of the terrorist attack upon your country's economy ?
<speaker2> Once the US economy is in trouble due to the terrorist attack , the impact could be quickly felt in the rest of the world .
<speaker1> What challenges is your country's economy facing at the moment ?
<speaker2> We do face a lot of challenges because there is still much uncertainty about the world economy . It's very important for us to strike a proper balance between investment in fixed assets and household consumption .

<speaker1> The MYOMA is very popular . There will be a lot of people .
<speaker2> MYOMA ? What's that ?
<speaker1> Oh , sorry.It stands for the Museum of Modern Art . It's an acronym . M O M A MYOMA .
<speaker2> I see . Do you have any suggestions for other things we should do ?
<speaker1> I suggest you go to the Jewish Museum.It ' s not far from the Guggenheim , near Central Park . It is really very interesting.Also , there is a great museum of medieval European art further up north.It ' s called the Cloisters .
<speaker2> How can we get up there ?
<speaker1> You can take a bus .
<speaker2> But Larry says the neighborhoods in the north are dangerous .

<speaker1> I've only washed my clothes here a couple times .
<speaker2> Why don't you wash clothes at home ?
<speaker1> I would , if my washing machine wasn't broken .
<speaker2> Why don't you just get it fixed ?

<speaker1> What should I do to prepare for a job interview ?
<speaker2> An understanding of the basic workings of a company and the services or goods it provides is essential . Do you have that ?
<speaker1> Sort of , but I could know more , I guess .
<speaker2> With that understanding , you can figure out what your company is looking for in terms of basic attitude . Right ?
<speaker1> I think that they are a very formal company .
<speaker2> What you wear is important . So keep in mind what is suitable for the company and type of work you will be doing . Need help ?
<speaker1> I need a lot of help in this area .
<speaker2> In addition to clothes we need to think about other basics , OK ?

<speaker1> Fortunately for you , you don't . Next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
<speaker2> That's good advice .
<speaker1> Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
<speaker2> Are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
<speaker1> Let me see here ... yes , there's one left .
<speaker2> Ok . I'll take that one then .
<speaker1> Alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
<speaker2> I like to travel light so I just have this one .
<speaker1> If that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?
<speaker2> Yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ?

<speaker1> I need a pan .
<speaker2> Okay . Do you have a particular size in mind ?
<speaker1> Well , the bigger the better , I think .
<speaker2> Look at this one . It's our biggest pan .
<speaker1> Yes , that is big enough , but it's too heavy for me .

<speaker1> The one right at the back .
<speaker2> I'm afraid we can ' t save that one . It will have to come out .
<speaker1> Will it hurt much ?
<speaker2> I'll give you an injection , then you won't feel pain .
<speaker1> ( 5 minutes later ) OK , it's all over . Spit there and bite the cotton ball tightly in place for half an hour .

<speaker1> It's raining heavily .

<speaker2> I understand .

<speaker1> Well , Mr . Smith . That's a nasty infection you have .
<speaker2> Yes . Is there anything you can give me to get rid of it , doctor ?
<speaker1> I'm going to prescribe some antibiotics and some cream to ease the itching and burning .
<speaker2> Ok , thank you ! Where should I buy them ?
<speaker1> The pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic .
<speaker2> Great ! What floor is pharmacy on ?
<speaker1> The fourth . I'll send the prescription down there so you can just pick it up on your way out .
<speaker2> Thank you !

<speaker1> How can I help you ?
<speaker2> well , I'm looking for some summer clothes .
<speaker1> Oh , it is the right time for you purchasing in our clothes shop . We are now having a low price on all our summer apparel .
<speaker2> Really ? What's that ?
<speaker1> Everything for summer is 20 % off .
<speaker2> I like this T-shirt . Would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with it ?
<speaker1> Sure . We have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the T-shirt . Look at this section .

<speaker1> 160 yuan .
<speaker2> Here you are .

<speaker2> I got a sandwich , some chips , and a soda .
<speaker1> Did you bring that from home ?
<speaker2> I got it from the cafeteria .
<speaker1> What kind of sandwich did you get ?
<speaker2> They messed up my order and gave me a bologna sandwich .
<speaker1> How was it ?
<speaker2> Considering it wasn't what I ordered , it was still pretty good .
<speaker1> I think I got a sandwich there once before .
<speaker2> Really ?
<speaker1> Yes , and they didn't get my order right either .

<speaker1> Could you project what you would like to be doing five years from now ?
<speaker2> As I have some administrative experience from my last job , I may use my organizational and planning skills in the future .
<speaker1> How do you plan to accomplish this ?
<speaker2> By doing everything necessary and for further study .
<speaker1> How long would you like to stay with this company ?
<speaker2> How long I will stay with the company depends on whether the company and I are satisfied with each other .

<speaker2> I got stuck in a traffic jam .
<speaker1> Hurry up , the show is about to start .
<speaker2> It looks like you're very interested in the circus .
<speaker1> Yes , I love to see the animal show .
<speaker2> I have never seen those before , but since you're so excited it should be good .
<speaker1> I'm sure you'll love it .
<speaker2> Okay , I will go and get some popcorn first .

<speaker1> May I have a cookie ?
<speaker2> Help yourself .

<speaker1> What's the matter ?
<speaker2> Checking out , please .
<speaker1> Can I have your keys , please ? Thank you . Here's your statement .
<speaker2> Excuse me . What are these charges ?
<speaker1> Oh , these are the phone charges and these are for something from the bar .
<speaker2> Wait a minute . I made a phone call , but I never made a connection .
<speaker1> I know , sir . Those aren't telephone company charges . Those are hotel charges .
<speaker2> Isn't that a bit excessive ?
<speaker1> I'm sorry , sir . It's our policy .
<speaker2> OK . Here is the money .
<speaker1> Thank you . Welcome to our hotel again .

<speaker1> Can I help you , sir ?
<speaker2> Yes , I'd like to look at some suits .
<speaker1> Oh , this way please . What size do you wear ?
<speaker2> Size 41 . I want something in dark flannel .
<speaker1> How about this one ?
<speaker2> It feels all right . But if it were a darker color , I'd like it better . This seems too light for winter . Do you think you could get me one ?
<speaker1> All right . I'll show you something darker . Do you like this one ?
<speaker2> It looks good . But can I try it on ?
<speaker1> Of course . Let me help you .
<speaker2> Thanks . It's comfortable . Well , how much is it , please ?
<speaker1> $ 280 .
<speaker2> Ok . I'll take it . Here's the money .

<speaker1> Mike , you're seventeen years old , right ?
<speaker2> Yeah , Why ?
<speaker1> You look quite mature beside your cousin who is eighteen .
<speaker2> You can bet on that .

<speaker1> Come in and sit down .
<speaker2> Thanks , Mr . Liang .
<speaker1> Among all the assistants , I think you're on top of it . Based on the annual evaluation , the board of directors decided to give you a bonus .
<speaker2> Really ? I am too happy .
<speaker1> I've been reviewing your work over the past few months . Thanks to your excellent work , we benefit much from your project . And you should get the perfect attendance award too .
<speaker2> Thanks for your trust . Owing to my colleagues ' help , I've successfully completed my task .
<speaker1> You are very modest and diligent . The distribution of bonus derived from the performance evaluation . You deserve it .
<speaker2> Thank you very much . I will redouble my efforts in the future .

<speaker1> Donna ! How are you ? It's good to hear your voice .
<speaker2> Thank you . Jack , it's always a pleasure doing business with you .
<speaker1> So how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave ?
<speaker2> Great ! And , how are things in your neck of the woods ?
<speaker1> Things are so great here . I almost smiled myself to death last week . One of my coworkers had to give me CPR .
<speaker2> Oh.Jack , I have missed your sense of humor.Ha ha ha ! Nobody else sees things quite like you do.It ' s your gift .
<speaker1> Or a curse .
<speaker2> Nope , it's a gift.Anyway , we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time .
<speaker1> That , my dear , was classic sales technique delivered by a professional .
<speaker2> Are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit ?
<speaker1> Heck no , we doubled the price , but because it's you , I'll let you have'em at 50 off .
<speaker2> You silver-tongued devil . Can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no ?
<speaker1> I could , but where's the fun in that ?

<speaker1> Hi . I
<speaker2> s safe to leave to get a quick bite ?
<speaker1> I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ?
<speaker2> What seems to be the problem ?
<speaker1> It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . It happens all the time . No need to worry .
<speaker2> Umm ... You know ... Actually I was thinking of trying another airline . No need to hold my seat .

<speaker1> I need to go to the ATM .
<speaker2> So , why don
<speaker1> s it .

<speaker1> Would you like something to drink ?
<speaker2> Yes please . Do you have any teas ?
<speaker1> Of course we have lots of teas ?
<speaker2> What do you recommend ?
<speaker1> What about a green tea or perhaps a jasmine tea ?
<speaker2> What
<speaker1> s Oolong tea – it
<speaker2> ll try that .

<speaker1> May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ?
<speaker2> Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing !
<speaker1> Why are they all in glass boxes ?
<speaker2> For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air .
<speaker1> So there isn't air in the glass boxes ?
<speaker2> No , there isn't . They are all vacuumed .
<speaker1> I wonder how old these things are , thousands of years ?
<speaker2> Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time .
<speaker1> Hey , look at the three-leg cup . I've seen it on TV .
<speaker2> The bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless !
<speaker1> Yeah , it has no value at all . Who will use this cup today ?
<speaker2> Danny , priceless means so valuable that you can't put a price on it .
<speaker1> Oh , it does ?

<speaker1> I am so worried about this English contest . I have butterflies in my stomach now !
<speaker2> I have confidence in you . Believe in yourself .

<speaker1> What would you like on your pizzas ?
<speaker2> We want one vegetarian supreme and one double pepperoni .
<speaker1> Would you like anything to drink with that ? For $ 1.50 , you can get a two-liter bottle of Coke .
<speaker2> No , thanks .
<speaker1> All right . That'll be $ 12.50 . Your pizzas will be there in 30 minutes .
<speaker2> Thanks .

<speaker1> We are redecorating and I'm going to add some things .
<speaker2> Well , I'll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office .
<speaker1> Shall we meet at 1:15 this Thursday ? We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .
<speaker2> Fine , I'll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday .

<speaker1> Can you tell me the way to library ?
<speaker2> Sure , turn left at the next crossing .
<speaker1> Is it on Xinhua street ?
<speaker2> Yes . You can't miss it .

<speaker1> Comfort Inn , may I help you ?
<speaker2> I
<speaker1> re in luck ! We
<speaker2> Ve got a Single Super Saver Special going on right now – only $ 30 a night . And we
<speaker1> s a good deal . Since this is a working trip , I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients .
<speaker2> Yes , we have five meeting rooms , of various sizes . We can accommodate large meetings and small , informal gatherings as well . Of course , if you have many small meeting , you might consider checking
<speaker1> That sounds great . Do you accept checks ?
<speaker2> I
<speaker1> t . But we do accept all major credit cards .

<speaker1> I am sorry to trouble you , but there's a lot of noise in the next room .
<speaker2> Oh , is there ? Which room is it ?
<speaker1> It's . I think , neighbours on the right .
<speaker2> You mean the room thirteen-thirteen ?
<speaker1> I'm not sure , but I think so . I'm very exhausted , but I can't sleep .
<speaker2> All right , ma'am . I'll check and tell them to be quiet .
<speaker1> If next room is still noisy , could you give me a different room , please ?

<speaker1> Have you ever been to Xi
<speaker2> Ve been there several times on business trips . But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city .
<speaker1> I
<speaker2> t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place .
<speaker1> I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening .
<speaker2> Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ?
<speaker1> Well , the airport is quite far from the downtown area , but it is still more convenient than taking the train .

<speaker1> A ticket to London , please .
<speaker2> A cheap day return ticket ?
<speaker1> Yes , including London Tube .
<speaker2> That'll be twelve pounds .

<speaker1> Doctor , what is the best way to stay healthy ?
<speaker2> Having a good diet is probably the most important thing .
<speaker1> It is very confusing to know what to eat .
<speaker2> You need plenty of fruits and vegetables , small amounts of protein , and whole grains .
<speaker1> Are there certain things that I should avoid ?
<speaker2> You shouldn
<speaker1> t overdo it , a glass of wine a day should be OK .

<speaker1> Darling , I am back . What are you doing ?
<speaker2> I am washing clothes . Are you hungry now ? Wait for a moment , I'll cook dinner for you . ( Steven bends his brows )
<speaker1> B , should we get a maid ?
<speaker2> I can do all the housework . We don't need a maid .
<speaker1> You have worked very hard in the office . If we can get someone to help you , you can have more rest .
<speaker2> We really don't need to .
<speaker1> You are a good wife , Julia . But you must take care of yourself .
<speaker2> Give me some time to think about it .

<speaker1> Can I reserve a room from the 13th to the 18th ?
<speaker2> Certainly . How do you like your room ?
<speaker1> I'd like a suite . What's the rate ?
<speaker2> $ 40 per night .

<speaker1> Is there anything I can do for you ?
<speaker2> Excuse me , can I change my order ? I am afraid I don't have so much time to enjoy my dinner .
<speaker1> I am sorry , sir . Your fish will be ready in five minutes so you can't change it .
<speaker2> That's all right .

<speaker1> Have you graduated now ?
<speaker2> Yes . I graduated this past June .
<speaker1> Which university did you graduate from ?
<speaker2> Guangzhou University .
<speaker1> What degree did you receive ?
<speaker2> I received a bachelor's degree in Economics .
<speaker1> What courses did you take in college ?
<speaker2> My major courses were Microeconomics , Macroeconomics , International Trade , International Finance , World Economy , Psychology and Business English
<speaker1> Why did you choose to study Economics ?
<speaker2> Because I was quite interested in Economics then .
<speaker1> Can you speak other languages except English ?
<speaker2> I can also speak a little Japanese .
<speaker1> I am very satisfied with your answers .
<speaker2> Thank you very much .

<speaker1> Once you arrive at the American airport , please call me .
<speaker2> OK , don

<speaker1> Sorry , Mary , I can't make it in time for dinner .
<speaker2> Okay , Bob , when will I see you ?
<speaker1> Maybe I will be around later .
<speaker2> Okay , I'll see you later .

<speaker1> I am sorry , sir . I have broken the reading lamp in my room .
<speaker2> Well , sir . May I have your room number ?
<speaker1> 503 . I would like to pay for it .
<speaker2> Please fill out the form first .
<speaker1> OK , can you bring me a new one ?
<speaker2> Of course .

<speaker1> Excuse me . I need to refill this prescription .
<speaker2> It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
<speaker1> Yes , I need to refill it today .
<speaker2> Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice .
<speaker1> I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not .
<speaker2> Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
<speaker1> Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ?
<speaker2> I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out .
<speaker1> But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription .
<speaker2> Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never .
<speaker1> But I have a prescription . I just need more of it .
<speaker2> A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
<speaker1> Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
<speaker2> Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry .
<speaker1> This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it .
<speaker2> Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too .

<speaker1> What are you doing ?
<speaker2> I

<speaker1> There are so many record players here . That is hard to choose .
<speaker2> Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
<speaker1> I'd rather get one with separated speakers.They give a clear sound .
<speaker2> Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
<speaker1> That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony .
<speaker2> Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration .

<speaker1> Ahhchooo !
<speaker2> You've been sneezing a lot lately . Are you sick or something ?
<speaker1> No . Every spring time around April , I'm stricken with allergies .
<speaker2> I never have seasonal allergies .
<speaker1> Consider yourself lucky .
<speaker2> What are all the symptoms ?
<speaker1> Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water .
<speaker2> That doesn't sound good .
<speaker1> No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ?
<speaker2> Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family .
<speaker1> Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol .
<speaker2> I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body .
<speaker1> That's pretty bad .
<speaker2> But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah .

<speaker1> Let's have a look at the map first .
<speaker2> All right . Wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here .
<speaker1> Let's buy some tickets .
<speaker2> The train is coming . There are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train
<speaker1> Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ?
<speaker2> No , but it will be soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them .

<speaker1> What do you do ?
<speaker2> I'm an apprentice with a local engineering firm . My training lasts for two years . Two days a week I study Engineering at a local college . If I pass all my exams , I hope the company will take me on as an engineer .

<speaker1> I want to keep a pet , but I don't know which one to buy ?
<speaker2> Dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day .
<speaker1> Having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then .
<speaker2> What about cats ? They are more independent .
<speaker1> Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat .
<speaker2> How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ?
<speaker1> Yeah , are they easy to look after ?
<speaker2> Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything .

<speaker1> Can I be of any service to you ?
<speaker2> I've been told that Chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship . We'd like to take some home . What would you recommend ?
<speaker1> There are over a thousands kinds of articles in our shop.For example , there is tricolored pottery originating in the Tang Dynasty , embroidery , batik , jade carving , just to name a few.Do you have anything in mind ?
<speaker2> No , not really.But I think it should be something distinctively Chinese . And easy to carry .
<speaker1> I would suggest you buy paper-cuts , embroidery and batik.They are very easy to carry .
<speaker2> So , we'd like to see some embroidery .

<speaker1> Hey , Mary . We're back . Have you eaten yet ?
<speaker2> I had some bread for breakfast .
<speaker1> Let's go out for brunch .
<speaker2> Brunch ?
<speaker1> It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . On Sundays , many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch . Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also .
<speaker2> Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch .

<speaker1> Hi , my name is Sovia.What
<speaker2> m a podiatrist . What about you ?
<speaker1> I
<speaker2> d be great.Where would you like to go ?
<speaker1> Anywhere with you .
<speaker2> Aren

<speaker1> Oh , I'm starving . I'd like to try some real Chinese cuisine . What would you recommend , waiter ?
<speaker2> Well , it depends . You see , there are eight famous Chinese for instance , the Sichuan cuisine , and the Hunan cuisine .
<speaker1> They are both spicy hot , I've heard .
<speaker2> That's right . If you like hot dishes , you could try some .
<speaker1> They might be too hot for me .
<speaker2> Then there's the Cantonese cuisine and the Kiangsu cuisine . Most southerners like them .
<speaker1> What about any special Beijing dishes ?
<speaker2> There's the Beijing roast duck .
<speaker1> Oh , yes . I've heard a lot about it . I'd like very much to try it . Where can I find it ?
<speaker2> You can find it in most restaurants , but the best place is certainly Quanjude Restaurant .
<speaker1> Is it near here ?
<speaker2> Not too near but not too far either . A taxi will take you there in 15 minutes , If the traffic is not too bad , I mean .
<speaker1> Well , thank you for your information . But what is the name of that restaurant again ?
<speaker2> Let me write it down on this slip of paper for you . You can show it to the taxi-driver .
<speaker1> That's very kind of you . Thanks a lot .

<speaker1> hi , Isaiah . How are you ?
<speaker2> I
<speaker1> s your job going ?
<speaker2> I don
<speaker1> s fantastic . What kind of business is it ?
<speaker2> I
<speaker1> s it going ?

<speaker2> Pretty well . What about you ?
<speaker1> Fine . Where are the other guys ?
<speaker2> It's a bit disappointing that they are all out for a movie .
<speaker1> Bad timing . I want to see them so much . How are they ?
<speaker2> Not bad . I heard you are going to graduate this coming summer , right ?
<speaker1> Yes , that's why I'm here . I'm thinking about buying a second-hand apartment .
<speaker2> Did you go to a real estate agent ?
<speaker1> No , that will be too expensive .
<speaker2> That's true . By the way , what kind of apartment are you looking for ?
<speaker1> My first job's salary will be a bit low . So the cheaper the better . Just one I can afford .
<speaker2> Sure . I'll try my best to find a satisfying one for you .
<speaker1> I'll appreciate it so much .

<speaker1> Good afternoon .
<speaker2> My goodness ! It
<speaker1> t the time fly ! Do come in and sit down .
<speaker2> Thank you .
<speaker1> What
<speaker2> s half past twelve .

<speaker1> Yeah , that would be great . Thanks .

<speaker2> Use them from the outside in .
<speaker1> I see . A set for appetizers and another for the main course .
<speaker2> Right . We do the same thing at home . Don't you remember ?
<speaker1> Oh yeah . The big napkin goes on my lap .
<speaker2> Let's look at our menus .
<speaker1> Cindy , help me order because I'm still not very familiar with American cooking .
<speaker2> Well , we order appetizers first and then entrees .

<speaker1> It was nice talking to you .
<speaker2> Why are you trying to rush me off the phone ?
<speaker1> I really have to go .
<speaker2> Why ? I still wanted to talk to you .
<speaker1> I have things to do .
<speaker2> Like what ?
<speaker1> Don't be nosey .
<speaker2> I'm not . I just want to know .
<speaker1> Well , it's really none of your business .
<speaker2> That's harsh .
<speaker1> I'm sorry , but I have to go .
<speaker2> Fine .

<speaker1> Mom , will you have time to help me with my homework today ?

<speaker1> How come it is slow as a snail today ?
<speaker2> You mean the network connection ?
<speaker1> Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response for any click .
<speaker2> I have the same question . I can
<speaker1> d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately .
<speaker2> Ok .

<speaker1> I thought this was the emergency room .
<speaker2> It is . But unless you are critically injured , you still need to wait.You aren't bleeding , are you ?
<speaker1> No . Only a little . I fell off my porch .
<speaker2> Oh , that's terrible . Is it your right arm or your left arm ?
<speaker1> My left arm .
<speaker2> Can you fill out this form then ?
<speaker1> No , I can't . I'm left-handed .
<speaker2> That's very inconvenient for you then.You ' ll probably have a cast on your left arm .
<speaker1> Yes . But why do I have to fill out a form anyway ? This is the emergency room .
<speaker2> Yes , it is . But even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done.Have you ever been in an emergency room before ?

<speaker2> OK .
<speaker1> I feel well now .
<speaker2> Yes , some exercise is necessary for us .
<speaker1> Quite right .

<speaker1> I was wondering if you need any help on your new project .
<speaker2> Sure ! That would be great ! Are you good at writing or would you rather do the computer work ?
<speaker1> I would like to help with the computer work .
<speaker2> Great ! We are going to be working in teams of three . Are you OK working with others ?
<speaker1> Yes , I like working like that .
<speaker2> We will begin next Monday . Would you be available then ?

<speaker1> Congratulations , Francis . Your hard working finally pays off . I am so happy for your promotion .
<speaker2> Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it .
<speaker1> I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ?
<speaker2> Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don

<speaker2> Yes , sir . Where to ?
<speaker1> The city square , please .
<speaker2> Are you in a hurry ?
<speaker1> Yes , I have to be there to meet a friend at 5 thirty pm . So we're sure we can get there on time ?

<speaker2> The reading on the kilometer is 12 $ .

<speaker2> Do you need a receipt ?
<speaker1> No , thank you .

<speaker1> Janice , I can't find the document I was working on last month . Can you help me to look for it ?
<speaker2> Susan , I'm sorry . Did you look up those files I requested ?
<speaker1> Yes , but I still can not find it . Maybe it is in this cabinet .
<speaker2> I couldn't find the files you request , even though I checked all the cross-references . I don't think it's there .
<speaker1> I am sure that document was filed .
<speaker2> Well , let me check again under a different heading .
<speaker1> Good idea ! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files .
<speaker2> Maybe that's why I couldn't find it . All the documents on Nova are filed under ' V ' .

<speaker1> What would you have ?
<speaker2> I'll try Chinese wine .
<speaker1> What about this dry red ? It's good indeed , it never goes to the head .
<speaker2> OK . Give me one , please .

<speaker2> Thank you .
<speaker1> I'm always at your service .

<speaker2> Sure . I will clean the glasses for you .
<speaker1> Thank you . Where is the washing room ?
<speaker2> Walk straight and turn left .

<speaker1> What's wrong , officer ?
<speaker2> You do realize that you ran a red light , don't you ?
<speaker1> I did ?
<speaker2> You didn't see the red light ?
<speaker1> I'm sorry for running it , but I really didn't know .
<speaker2> Didn't you learn that red means stop ?
<speaker1> I know that .
<speaker2> Then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light .
<speaker1> I'm not sure .
<speaker2> I'm giving you a ticket for this .
<speaker1> I'm sorry for the misunderstanding .
<speaker2> Maybe you'll think about this before you decide to run another light .

<speaker1> Medicine Industry , this is Peter Bush speaking , can I help you ?
<speaker2> Good afternoon , could you connect this call with Mr Brown , please
<speaker1> May I know who's calling ?

<speaker2> Alright , what's in them ? They are so heavy !
<speaker1> Just things we need for the picnic tomorrow .
<speaker2> Well , hurry up and open the door please . I told you these things are heavy .
<speaker1> I'm sorry , but I just can't find the key . You must have it .
<speaker2> Oh , yes , it's in my pocket . But how can I get the key while I'm holding all these bags ?

<speaker1> Excuse me . My name is Dan Ford . I have an appointment with the dentist at 3:30 .
<speaker2> Yes , Mr . Ford . The dentist will be ready to see you in a minute . Have a seat .
<speaker1> Thank you .

<speaker1> Isn't it past your bedtime already ?
<speaker2> I am not sleepy .
<speaker1> It's getting late , and you have to wake up early tomorrow .
<speaker2> There is no way that I can fall asleep right now .
<speaker1> Try listening to some soft music .
<speaker2> It won't work . I'm nowhere close to being tired .
<speaker1> I really don't care , just go to sleep .
<speaker2> What if I stay up and do something , until I get tired ?
<speaker1> You'll be up all night if I let you do that .
<speaker2> I'm going to get to sleep eventually .
<speaker1> You need to go to sleep now , so go to sleep .
<speaker2> Good night .

<speaker1> I want to go try on these clothes .
<speaker2> What did you find ?
<speaker1> I found some jeans , and a new blouse .
<speaker2> Go and try it on .
<speaker1> What do you think ?
<speaker2> I love that shirt on you .
<speaker1> What about the jeans ?
<speaker2> They don't really fit you right .
<speaker1> I don't think so either .
<speaker2> That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you though .
<speaker1> Well , I'll just buy the shirt .
<speaker2> That would be a good idea .

<speaker1> Now , Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I
<speaker2> m quite impressed .
<speaker1> Thank you very much . I
<speaker2> s any questions please feel free to ask me .
<speaker1> Well yes , I do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I
<speaker2> m 27 and grew up in Brooklyn , New York , although our family moved to London when I was quite young , at around sixteen .
<speaker1> Ah I see , so you were actually educated in Europe ?
<speaker2> Yes precisely . Although I was born in the US , I would definitely call London home . But as you see I
<speaker1> m really looking to settle down .
<speaker2> I see . okay , well let

<speaker1> Can you tell me , Ms . Smith , about the training programs you initiated this year ?
<speaker2> We ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained .
<speaker1> What

<speaker1> Well , good morning , Tom . I haven't seen you for a long time .
<speaker2> I'd been feeling pretty well until just a few days ago .
<speaker1> What seems to be the trouble now ?
<speaker2> I feel run down , tired . I've been having headaches almost every day . And I'm not getting as much sleep as usually do .
<speaker1> Have you been eating properly ? Eating the right kind of food is important for your health , you know .
<speaker2> Well , I haven't been eating well , I guess . I usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch .
<speaker1> And what about dinner ?
<speaker2> Sometimes I'm too tired to eat anything at all .
<speaker1> That's not good . You don't have a well-balanced diet . Have you been taking vitamin pills ?
<speaker2> I don't like to take any medicine at all without talking it over with a doctor first .

<speaker1> We
<speaker2> s books for her daughter .
<speaker1> I want to look at nelson Mandela

<speaker1> Doctor , I have the worst toothache !

<speaker1> Let's go to the animal shelter .
<speaker2> What do you want to do ?
<speaker1> I want to get a puppy for my son .
<speaker2> That will make him so happy .
<speaker1> I'll get him one of those little dogs .
<speaker2> One that won't grow up too big .
<speaker1> And eat too much .
<speaker2> Do you know which one he would like ?
<speaker1> Oh , yes , I took him there yesterday . He showed me one that he really liked .
<speaker2> I bet you had to drag him away .
<speaker1> He wanted to take it home yesterday .
<speaker2> I wonder what he'll name it .

<speaker1> Hello . I want to send the computer to my sister in Shanghai by logistics transport .
<speaker2> OK . Is it in the box ? May I see it ?
<speaker1> Yes . This is the computer and this is the keyboard and the monitor .
<speaker2> Is there anything else ?
<speaker1> There are a mouse and a camera .
<speaker2> Is that all ?
<speaker1> Yes . How much is it to send these things to Shanghai by regular delivery ?
<speaker2> It depends on the weight of these things . Generally speaking , we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram .
<speaker1> I see . Can you weigh them for me , please ?
<speaker2> Please go over there to weigh them .
<speaker1> OK . See you later .

<speaker1> what happened ? Why didn't he win ?
<speaker2> didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .
<speaker1> how did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
<speaker2> if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .
<speaker1> what ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
<speaker2> he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
<speaker1> I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
<speaker2> they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
<speaker1> that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
<speaker2> I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
<speaker1> regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .
<speaker2> I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
<speaker1> let's hope so .

<speaker1> I need to use the ATM .
<speaker2> What
<speaker1> m not sure how .
<speaker2> I don
<speaker1> Ve never used one before .
<speaker2> I can help you figure it out .
<speaker1> What do I have to do ?
<speaker2> Slide your card into the machine .
<speaker1> Then what ?
<speaker2> You need to type your PIN in .
<speaker1> What do I have to do next ?
<speaker2> Click on whichever option you want , and you

<speaker1> What are you doing ? Checking the " to do " list for the wedding ?
<speaker2> Yep . There's still so much to do !
<speaker1> So let's start by checking off what we've already done .
<speaker2> Did you reconfirm the plane reservations for all the Taiwanese guests ?
<speaker1> Not yet , I was busy getting that videographer who films stuff for the Net .
<speaker2> Cool ! I can't believe he agreed to go all the way to Dallas with us !
<speaker1> Hey ! We're paying for his ticket !

<speaker1> It is my first time coming to China . I want to buy something unique of China to my friends as gifts .
<speaker2> We have a great variety of Chinese antiques and porcelain . Do you like them ?
<speaker1> Yes , I love them , but they are fragile . It is not convenient to take them .
<speaker2> You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ?
<speaker1> Sounds good . May I have a look ?
<speaker2> Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on .
<speaker1> They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs .
<speaker2> All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality .
<speaker1> Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ?
<speaker2> This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac .
<speaker1> Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones .
<speaker2> OK , I will wrap them for you .

<speaker1> Can you make out what he's saying ?
<speaker2> No , it's too loud in here .

<speaker1> Excuse me .
<speaker2> Yes ?
<speaker1> Can you tell me the way to the Peak Tram , please ?
<speaker2> Certainly . Go along Queen's Road ...
<speaker1> Along Queen's Road ...
<speaker2> Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel .
<speaker1> Right at the Hilton .
<speaker2> Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral .
<speaker1> The Cathedral ?
<speaker2> Yes . Then cross the road at the next traffic lights . The Peak Tram is straight ahead . You can't miss it .
<speaker1> That's very kind of you . Thank you . Er ... have you got a pencil ?
<speaker2> Yes . Why ?
<speaker1> Can you repeat all that ? I think I'd better write it down .

<speaker1> Hi , Nally , are you hungry ?
<speaker2> I'm starving . Let's go grab a bite .
<speaker1> Where to ?
<speaker2> How about Karlis ?
<speaker1> Are you kidding ? That place is too ritzy for lunch .
<speaker2> True . ok Let's go to Grumose ?
<speaker1> Same thing , meals there all coarsen arm and leg .
<speaker2> I guess it is a little pricy .
<speaker1> Let's stop it at Multicolor for a quick lunch ..
<speaker2> That will be Ok . Come on , I can't wait to chow down .
<speaker1> That was a great lunch , the food was good , but the service was lousy .
<speaker2> Is that why you stiffed the waiter ?
<speaker1> You got it . All right , Let's go back to school .

<speaker1> Good morning , sir .
<speaker2> Good morning . I'd like a business suit made with this material .
<speaker1> Do you have a particular style in mind ?
<speaker2> The kind that never goes out of fashion , I guess .
<speaker1> I think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes .
<speaker2> I'm sure you're right . I just dread the idea of making a new suit every year .
<speaker1> The changes are usually not that dramatic . We just got some pictures of the latest fashion . Would you like to take a look ?
<speaker2> Good . I think I'll choose this single breasted one . When can I get it ?
<speaker1> Next Friday .
<speaker2> Thank you .

<speaker1> Oh , gosh ! I feel everything around me is against me .
<speaker2> Don't take it too hard . There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 .
<speaker1> Well , I am all ears . Maybe they are helpful .
<speaker2> Firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . And secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . The last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age .
<speaker1> I understand what you mean , and I will not upset myself . Face it .
<speaker2> Good luck to us .

<speaker1> Look , Mary ! There are so many people over there !
<speaker2> Oh , I remember , there is a job fair in the personnel market .
<speaker1> I have never been to the personnel market .
<speaker2> Really ? I have been there several times .
<speaker1> Are there many employers ?
<speaker2> Yes . The personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers .
<speaker1> So there will be many large companies in the personnel market , right ?
<speaker2> Yes , there are many famous corporations .
<speaker1> When will there be a job fair ?
<speaker2> Every Saturday and Sunday
<speaker1> Do I need to pay to go into the personnel market ?
<speaker2> No , it's free .
<speaker1> How about going there to have a look now ?
<speaker2> OK , let's go .

<speaker1> Could you show me the T-shirt on the model ?
<speaker2> Here you are . We have three different colors , white , blue and pink .
<speaker1> What's the price ?
<speaker2> $ 12 .
<speaker1> Can you make it any cheaper ?
<speaker2> It is cheap .
<speaker1> I'll take it if you give me a discount .
<speaker2> $ 10 . That's the best I can do .
<speaker1> OK . I'll take the blue one .

<speaker1> Hello , again . Did you discuss everything with your colleagues ?
<speaker2> Yes , yes . It seems that everything is settled .
<speaker1> Have you decided how you would like the salaries paid ?
<speaker2> We have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees's accounts , whether they are currently with this bank or not .
<speaker1> That's not a problem .
<speaker2> Of course , if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank , or open new accounts with you .
<speaker1> Thank you very much . We always welcome new customers .

<speaker1> I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking .
<speaker2> We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments .
<speaker1> I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house .
<speaker2> We need to find a good realtor .
<speaker1> Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .
<speaker2> What do you mean ?
<speaker1> Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .
<speaker2> But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .
<speaker1> Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .
<speaker2> I still think we should have a realtor.We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also , the realtor will inspect the house.He can tell us if the house has
<speaker1> Of course we need a home inspector.But we can hire an inspector on our own.And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .
<speaker2> So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?
<speaker1> It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .
<speaker2> And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?
<speaker1> Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .
<speaker2> Why ?
<speaker1> Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .
<speaker2> Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .
<speaker1> It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .
<speaker2> I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .
<speaker1> Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store .

<speaker1> I'm calling about our appointment . I can't call on you this evening.My wife is terribly ill .
<speaker2> Sorry to hear that .
<speaker1> How about next week ?
<speaker2> Fine , we'll be expecting you then .

<speaker1> Which restaurant do you prefer ?
<speaker2> I'd like to taste Mexican food .
<speaker1> How about the one on Baker Street ?
<speaker2> Oh , I've never seen a better Mexican restaurant .

<speaker1> The numbers in this table don't seem to be in accord with reality .
<speaker2> I know , but these are the figures that we came up with .

<speaker1> Oh , so the zoo is over there . Thank you so much for your help .
<speaker2> You
<speaker1> m actually travelling around Asia .
<speaker2> Oh , very nice . How long will you be in Beijing ?
<speaker1> Probably another week .
<speaker2> Oh , I see . Well , I
<speaker1> s very kind .

<speaker1> Could you type up this document for me , Sandra ?
<speaker2> Sure , but I have to finish this report first .
<speaker1> Never mind . I'll do it .

<speaker1> Are you interested in mountaineering ?
<speaker2> Yes , in some sense . I should say I like mountain climbing , you know , because I'm not so professional . How about you
<speaker1> I'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . I went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation . We spent two days in the mountains .
<speaker2> How did you spend the night there ?

<speaker2> Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother .
<speaker1> Well , what kind of books does she like ?
<speaker2> She's very fond of detective stories ?
<speaker1> I see.Has she read any detective stories ?
<speaker2> Oh , yes !
<speaker1> Do you know if she's read this one ?
<speaker2> I'm not sure , but she probably won't remember if she has ! She's very forgetful !
<speaker1> Ah ! She has a bad memory.How old is she ?

<speaker1> Hey , Jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the TV all day . Anything interesting on TV ?
<speaker2> Not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements .
<speaker1> Why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air .
<speaker2> I know , I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world !
<speaker1> Really ? What's the series about ?
<speaker2> Well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it .
<speaker1> It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth .
<speaker2> I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results .
<speaker1> Really ? that's interesting !
<speaker2> Yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good .
<speaker1> OK , I'll give it a go .

<speaker1> Hello , hot water overflowed from the bathtub . Would you help me ?

<speaker2> I will have our housekeeper come right away .
<speaker1> I am sorry , I was too tired to fall asleep .
<speaker2> When you woke up , the water was coming out the tub ?
<speaker1> Right . Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ?

<speaker1> Hi . I'm looking for a gift for my niece .

<speaker1> Oh , I like Digital Barbie ! How much does she cost ?
<speaker2> This Barbie is only $ 29.95 .
<speaker1> That's perfect . Let me have her .
<speaker2> Very good . Is there anything else you would like ?
<speaker1> No , that'll do it for now .

<speaker2> Here's your change and receipt . Thank you .

<speaker1> Please put your baggage on the counter and open it , let me have a look .
<speaker2> Yes , sir . Please examine it .
<speaker1> Anything subject to duty in your suitcase ?
<speaker2> No , sir . Nothing except my personal belongings , such as clothes , notebooks and some gifts .
<speaker1> Any cigarettes or liquor ?
<speaker2> I have cigarettes for my own use .
<speaker1> I think you'll have to pay some duty on these cigarettes because they exceed the quota . And this article is liable for duty .
<speaker2> How much duty should I pay ?
<speaker1> One hundred dollars .
<speaker2> Here is the money .
<speaker1> Just a moment . I'll make out your duty memo . ( Writing and giving the memo to Mr . Green ) Take it and pay the girl over there .
<speaker2> Thank you .

<speaker1> So that concludes the introduction . Now let's move to the first part of my talk , which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan . So first , right off the bat , When looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ...
<speaker2> We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ...
<speaker1> That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket .

<speaker1> Excuse me , sir , may I talk to you ?
<speaker2> Bill ! Sure , come on in . What can I do for you ?

<speaker2> What's so interesting about it ?
<speaker1> Well , this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up , half his face had been bitten off !
<speaker2> What ? How did that happen ?
<speaker1> They think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't , so ended up biting him in his face .
<speaker2> Wow . What does his look like now ?
<speaker1> It looks pretty frightening . He doesn't have any lips , so all you can see are his gums and teeth . Most of his nose and chin are missing too .
<speaker2> What did he look like before his dog bit his face off ?
<speaker1> He was actually quite handsome . What a shame .
<speaker2> What's he going to do now ?
<speaker1> It said that he's hoping to get a face transplant , but until then , he's looking forward to Halloween so he isn't the only one wearing a mask .

<speaker2> Come on ! We have been here for almost an hour ! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish !
<speaker1> Are you crazy ? You have no idea what you are talking about ! Just for my eyes I have to get eye-liner , an eyelash curler , eye shadow , an eyebrow pencil and mascara . Then I need to get foundation , liq
<speaker2> Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I
<speaker1> s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon !
<speaker2> What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ...
<speaker1> Fine ! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon !

<speaker1> A cup of coffee sounds good , doesn't it ?
<speaker2> Yes , but I think I'll have orange juice first .
<speaker1> Do you feel like having anything to eat ?
<speaker2> Well , I think I'll try the pancakes . How about you ?

<speaker1> Hey there Chris , what are you up to ?
<speaker2> I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models .
<speaker1> Oh , so you're thinking about buying a new car ?
<speaker2> Yeah , it looks that way . My wife has been bugging me about it . I thought we could probably survive without one , but with a baby on the way , maybe it is time to get a car .
<speaker1> So this would be your first automobile ?
<speaker2> That's right . For quite a few years , I rode a bicycle to work . Then I got a motorbike .
<speaker1> Yeah , I think I can understand your wife's position . Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order .
<speaker2> Oh ... I don't let her ride with me . It's just too dangerous . She takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot .
<speaker1> So it's time to buy your very first car ! Wow , that's exciting !
<speaker2> Yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility .
<speaker1> Yeah . I still remember my first car . It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17 . I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car .
<speaker2> I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us .
<speaker1> Yeah , it is a tough call . Each one has its pros and cons . Are you looking for a sedan ?
<speaker2> Yes , I'd like a Jeep , but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives .
<speaker1> I'd advise you to listen to your wife . She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice .

<speaker1> Can I help you ?
<speaker2> I'd like to send a fax to Shenzhen .
<speaker1> Is it a photograph or a document ?
<speaker2> Each of both .
<speaker1> Could I see both of them ?
<speaker2> Here you are .
<speaker1> You can't send this document ; it is not clear enough to send . The photograph is all right .
<speaker2> Well , how long will it take to arrive in Shenzhen ?
<speaker1> Couple of minutes .
<speaker2> Great . How much ?
<speaker1> 5 $ . You should change another much clearer photograph for fax .
<speaker2> Thank you . I will deal with it .

<speaker1> Good morning , can I see your passport , please ?
<speaker2> Here you are .
<speaker1> For business or pleasure ?
<speaker2> Business .
<speaker1> Thank you . Have a pleasant stay .

<speaker1> Take care , Peter . Don't run so fast . Are you tired ?
<speaker2> Oh , yes . May I sit on the grass ?
<speaker1> No , you mustn't sit on the grass . Don't you see the notes ?
<speaker2> Yes , I can see it . But what's on it ?
<speaker1> It says ' Keep off the grass ! '
<speaker2> Well , there's a bench under the tree . We can sit there .
<speaker1> Be careful . You can't smoke here .
<speaker2> Why not ?
<speaker1> Can't you see the notes there ? It says ' No smoking here ' .

<speaker1> I'd like a double room .

<speaker2> Wait a second , PLS . Yes , Mr . Lee , we have a room reserved for you . How long do you plan to stay ?
<speaker1> Probably two days . My wife will join me tomorrow . Then we will decide when to leave for Seattle .
<speaker2> Would you sign the register , PLS ?
<speaker1> By the way , does my room have a private bath ?
<speaker2> Certainly , every room in this hotel has a private bath .
<speaker1> Does my room have twin beds or a double ? I prefer a room with twin beds .
<speaker2> Your room has twin beds , Mr.Lee . It also has a view . I am sure you will like it . This is your key . It's on the eighth floor room 801 . The elevator's over there .
<speaker1> Thank you . One more thing , where is your restaurant ?
<speaker2> The restaurant is on the second floor . We also have a cafeteria on the top floor . If you would like something to drink , you can either call room service or come down here . The bar is right behind the lobby .
<speaker1> Thank you , you are very kind !
<speaker2> You are welcome !

<speaker1> I need to find a bus that'll take me to the Gold Line .
<speaker2> Where do you live ?

<speaker2> All right . Now what ?
<speaker1> Now you put the key in the ignition and start the car .
<speaker2> Which direction should I take ?
<speaker1> Make a left on this next street .
<speaker2> Tell me how far to go .
<speaker1> Keep going until I tell you to stop .
<speaker2> Okay , but let me know ahead of time .
<speaker1> That's all for today , so park right there .
<speaker2> That was great . Thanks for taking me driving .

<speaker1> I'm after some chinese incense burner ? How's this one ?

<speaker1> I need your help .
<speaker2> Oh , what's up ?
<speaker1> I locked myself out . What do you suggest I do ?
<speaker2> Well , the best thing to do is to go down to the front desk and ask for a duplicate key .

<speaker1> Ahhs ! I'm beat !
<speaker2> What happened to you ? You look like you got hit by a tornado !
<speaker1> I just got back from fighting the crowds .

<speaker1> Grabbing , pushing and shoving ...

<speaker1> Do you have a swimming pool in this hotel ?
<speaker2> We don't have a swimming pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in the gym .
<speaker1> I never heard of a swim station . Is that like a train or bus station ?

<speaker1> my mp3 player is broken , so I want to change it for an mp4 player . Can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ?
<speaker2> an mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? You can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones .
<speaker1> Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try .
<speaker2> look at my cell phone . I can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . It's just like a PAD .
<speaker1> that's cool . I can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products .
<speaker2> that's Ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much .
<speaker1> yeah , if I buy a cell phone like this , I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go , and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 .
<speaker2> that's right . what's the flash memory of your old mp3 ?
<speaker1> 256MB .
<speaker2> then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512MB .

<speaker1> What can I get you ?
<speaker2> A cheeseburger and an order of french fries would be great .
<speaker1> Would you like anything to drink ?
<speaker2> I feel like having a Coke .
<speaker1> That's a good idea . I think I'll join you .
