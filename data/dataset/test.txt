<speaker1> Hey man , you wanna buy some weed ?
<speaker2> Some what ?
<speaker1> Weed ! You know ? Pot , Ganja , Mary Jane some chronic !
<speaker2> Oh , umm , no thanks .
<speaker1> I also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines .
<speaker2> No , I am ok , really .

<speaker1> The taxi drivers are on strike again .
<speaker2> What for ?
<speaker1> They want the government to reduce the price of the gasoline .
<speaker2> It is really a hot potato .

<speaker1> We've managed to reduce our energy consumption in our factory by about 15 per cent in the last two years .
<speaker2> That's excellent . How have you managed that ?
<speaker1> Mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system .
<speaker2> What does that mean exactly ?
<speaker1> Well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers .
<speaker2> What other sources of energy do you use ?
<speaker1> We don't use any fossil fuels . Most of our power comes from hydro-electric plants . We're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power .

<speaker1> Believe it or not , tea is the most popular beverage in the world after water .

<speaker1> Well , have you ever heard of Oulong tea and compressed tea ?
<speaker2> Oh , yeah . Oulong tea is good for one's health . isn't it ?
<speaker1> You surely know a lot about Chinese tea .
<speaker2> Sure , I like drinking tea at teahouses .
<speaker1> Oh , so do I .

<speaker1> Great . We can chat while enjoying a cup there .

<speaker1> How do you stick to only those foods ?
<speaker2> Actually , fruits and veggies are really good for you .
<speaker1> Yeah , I know , but what about the chicken ?

<speaker2> what would you do without me ?

I joined in Yangzi Evening News to work as a part-time journalist in 2006 .

<speaker2> I got fired .
<speaker1> How come ? Last time I saw you . You told me it was a good job , and you'd like to take it as a career . That was only one month ago . Why this sudden change ?
<speaker2> It's a long story . In a word , I didn't do a good job of it . I messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up .

<speaker1> Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet .
<speaker2> I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ?
<speaker1> My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight .
<speaker2> I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ?
<speaker1> Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .
<speaker2> You need a babysitter .
<speaker1> Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights .
<speaker2> I could have Suzy stay at my place .
<speaker1> I don't want to do that to you , Karen .
<speaker2> Why not ?
<speaker1> Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .
<speaker2> I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely .
<speaker1> I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .
<speaker2> I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .
<speaker1> I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older .
<speaker2> I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .
<speaker1> Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .

<speaker2> I am cooking now !
<speaker1> Are you good at cooking ?
<speaker2> I have studied its skills recently at a training school . I plan to run a restaurant , so I have to practise cooking !
<speaker1> It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? !
<speaker2> I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . Have you ever tried steamed fish ?
<speaker1> Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty .
<speaker2> That's the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much .
<speaker1> I have the same idea as yours .
<speaker2> It's OK . Please have a taste of it .
<speaker1> Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious .
<speaker2> Thank you for your praise .

<speaker1> A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due .
<speaker2> Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible .
<speaker1> I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries .
<speaker2> So do I .

<speaker2> I believe so .

<speaker1> Take a seat inside and see what you think.So you will take the Porsche then , sir ?
<speaker2> Yes , and I want to buy the insurance too . I think it's necessary .
<speaker1> You're smart to buy it . At 45 dollars for three days , it is a good deal .
<speaker2> Can I return the car in San Francisco ?
<speaker1> San Francisco ? No , sir.We only have this office here . You will have to return it here .
<speaker2> Really ? I heard in America you can return rental cars in different cities .
<speaker1> No , sir . That's only with the very big companies . I'm sorry , but this car must be returned to this lot .
<speaker2> Well , I guess I will have to drive back down then . Hmm . I didn't think of that .
<speaker1> Do you still want the car , sir ?
<speaker2> Yes . It will be fun . Driving back down the coast . My girlfriend will like it .
<speaker1> It's a beautiful drive .

<speaker1> Look at the show on TV . I am watching a food show at a very famous seafood restaurant . I really want to eat at that restaurant . I am a seafood lover .
<speaker2> Speaking of seafood , my mouth is watering . Let's go to the seafood restaurant in our neighborhood .
<speaker1> Sound great . Let's go !
<speaker2> Look at the crystal clear fridge . You can see so many kinds of seafood in it . They all look very fresh and delicious .

<speaker1> Get in . I'll take you .
<speaker2> About how much will it cost ?

<speaker2> It's a quarter to 12 . Could you please drive a little faster ?
<speaker1> Certainly .

<speaker1> You're made a good choice . This china tea set is unusual .
<speaker2> Where was it from ?
<speaker1> It was made in Jingdezhen .
<speaker2> Jingdezhen ? Isn't it called ' the capital of porcelain ' ?
<speaker1> You are right .
<speaker2> This is the very thing I've been dreaming of .
<speaker1> It is the best quality porcelain-the famous egg-shell China .
<speaker2> It must be most precious .
<speaker1> But it is really worth the price .

<speaker1> Hello , Miao Li , Where are you going ?

<speaker1> I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?
<speaker2> Alright .
<speaker1> It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .
<speaker2> Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .
<speaker1> Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .
<speaker2> Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .
<speaker1> It really hurts .
<speaker2> Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?
<speaker1> To hell with you . The accident was your fault .
<speaker2> I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?
<speaker1> To hell with you .

<speaker1> Good morning . Vane Theater , at your service .
<speaker2> Hello . I'm thinking about watching a Chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl . What's on this weekend ?
<speaker1> Well , there will be charity performance on Saturday night . And also , there will be a solo concert by an opera star on Sunday night .
<speaker2> It's a good thing that I have choices here . Can you tell me about the one on Saturday ?
<speaker1> Sure . It's to raise money for the homeless .
<speaker2> What about the performance itself ?
<speaker1> Oh , it's a reserved opera named The Monkey Creates Havoc in Heaven .
<speaker2> Wow , a story about the clever Monkey King . It's a classic and children's favorite .
<speaker1> It surely is . And the cast is really the best .
<speaker2> Wonderful ! How much is the ticket ?
<speaker1> The price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front , 200 for the middle , and 50 for the back .

<speaker1> All right . I want to bring everybody back on this subject . When can we start working on this ?

<speaker1> I tell you what , 2:00 is not available for me , but you can get started and I'll come by at around 3:00
<speaker2> That's fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ?
<speaker1> Perhaps one year , I'm not sure .

<speaker1> What dressing would you like on the salad ?
<speaker2> French dressing , please .
<speaker1> I beg your pardon ?
<speaker2> Oh , French dressing .
<speaker1> Sorry , it's not available now.Anything else ?
<speaker2> We still prefer French dressing .

<speaker1> Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ?
<speaker2> Sure . First of all , it
<speaker1> t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic .
<speaker2> Yeah , that's very important .
<speaker1> So you
<speaker2> ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .
<speaker1> That
<speaker2> s always easier to say something than to do it .
<speaker1> It
<speaker2> s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes .
<speaker1> You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous .
<speaker2> I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time .
<speaker1> You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .
<speaker2> It seems that ' clothes make the man ' .
<speaker1> It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior .

<speaker1> The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ?
<speaker2> No idea . Your guess is as good as mine .
<speaker1> It better be more than last year .
<speaker2> Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see .

<speaker1> I'm sorry , our appointment has to be changed .
<speaker2> What a pity !
<speaker1> If you don't mind , may we put it off to the next day ?
<speaker2> That's OK .

<speaker2> That sounds fine , thanks for that . Let's go ahead !

<speaker1> My major was computer science when I was at college , and I am quite familiar with Visual C + + and Java language .
<speaker2> Well , what do you think about the development in computers ?
<speaker1> The developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software . In some regions , the hardware is completely replaced by software . So I think the software industry has a great future .
<speaker2> Have you ever designed any programs concerning network ?
<speaker1> Yes , I have designed some programs for the network with Visual C + + and I have passed the test for programmers - MUSE .
<speaker2> Have you got anything to ask me ?
<speaker1> Yes , can you tell me what's my responsibility in this position ?
<speaker2> Yes , of course . You would be responsible for the development of software products .
<speaker1> I see . This is my advantage .
<speaker2> Good . Have you got any other questions ?
<speaker1> No .

<speaker1> Thank you for your help .
<speaker2> No problem . Good luck

<speaker1> Wow ! Your fruit looks really fresh ! How much are these apples ?
<speaker2> The apples are 30NT each . How many would you like ?
<speaker1> Let's see , 30NT is about ... almost a dollar US . What ? ! How about these pineapples ?
<speaker2> They're 250NT each , but they're not edible . They're only used for worship .
<speaker1> Hmm , 250NT is ... 8 dollars ? ! ! And you can't even eat them ? You're crazy !
<speaker2> Wait ! Don't go just yet . These bananas are pretty cheap--only 35NT for this bunch .
<speaker1> Now that's more like it ! Bananas have lots of potassium , too !
<speaker2> They're also good for your digestion ! Would you like some kiwis , too ?
<speaker1> Are they from Taiwan ?
<speaker2> They're imported from New Zealand . Four for 50NT . Nine for a hundred .
<speaker1> OK . I'll take four kiwis .

<speaker1> Amelia , could you spare a few minutes ?
<speaker2> sure . What do you need ?
<speaker1> well , I wanted to let you know that I've put in my notice .
<speaker2> really ? Why ?
<speaker1> it's complicated . But basically it boils down to one thing . This company is downsizing and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go .
<speaker2> but surely they won't fire you ! You're one of the most experienced managers here !
<speaker1> well , to be honest , there's another reason . I've got a better offer .
<speaker2> well that's great news ! Congratulations ! Where will you be located ?

<speaker2> it'll be sad to see you go , but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity .
<speaker1> I have . I feel lucky . I look forward to dealing with overseas companies and at the same time having a chance to use English more .
<speaker2> I'm sorry to bring this up , but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go ?
<speaker1> of course I can . In fact , if there are other job opportunities at this new company , I'll recommend you personally .
<speaker2> thanks . I appreciate that .

<speaker2> You can ! With a little practice .
<speaker1> Look at him , he's buff .
<speaker2> I think he's hot too .
<speaker1> How do they all get in such tiptop shape ?
<speaker2> Exercised over and over . Exercise is a key .
<speaker1> That's it . I decided to turn over a new leaf . I'm going to exercise every single day .
<speaker2> Good for you , Leslie !

<speaker1> Excuse me . Check please .
<speaker2> OK , how was everything ?

<speaker2> You're welcome . Please come again .

<speaker1> You look upset , anything wrong ?
<speaker2> I'm going to quit the job .
<speaker1> Why ?
<speaker2> The task is tough .
<speaker1> You'd look before you leap .
<speaker2> Thanks for your concern .

<speaker1> How long will you stay in New York ?
<speaker2> Just tor three days . I won't need these luggages.CouId I put them here ?
<speaker1> I am sorry . If you have here more than 24 hours between connecting flights , we can't check your luggage through London .
<speaker2> Well , maybe I can put them in the airport storage there .
<speaker1> That's right . It's over there .

<speaker1> Eat some more .
<speaker2> No , thanks . I'm on a diet .

<speaker2> No , I haven't got one by now . I will go to the interview of yours .

<speaker1> I need help with the office party .
<speaker2> Yes , of course . We could split it . What part would you like to do , the food or the entertainment ?
<speaker1> I have no idea what the entertainment should be .
<speaker2> Let's make sure we are on the same page . Do we want a formal or informal gathering ?
<speaker1> Let's make it a formal affair .
<speaker2> Yes , that would be best . Now , for food should we have Chinese or American food ?

<speaker2> Thank you .

<speaker1> I want to see the man responsible for selling typewriters .
<speaker2> My name is Steven . I'm the Sales Manager of this company .
<speaker1> Well , look here . Ten new typewriters were delivered to my company yesterday afternoon and only five of them work properly .
<speaker2> Oh , I'm sorry about that .
<speaker1> Never mind being sorry , what are you going to do about it ?
<speaker2> Don't worry , we'll soon fix them .
<speaker1> Good , I hope you'll make sure that it won't happen again .
<speaker2> I'll certainly look into that .
<speaker1> Thank you . Goodbye .

<speaker1> I'm looking for a string of pearls for my wife .
<speaker2> Yes , sir . What price range do you have in mind ?
<speaker1> I'm not sure . I don't know very much about the price of pearls .
<speaker2> I see . Let me show you some samples of various qualities . This one is very nice . It's three hundred and fifty dollars .
<speaker1> Is there a price reduction ?
<speaker2> We are having a sale now . The price has already gone down .
<speaker1> How much is that one ?
<speaker2> It's two hundred and eighty dollars .
<speaker1> OK . I'll take it . Thank you .

<speaker1> Can I help you ?
<speaker2> Yes , I would like to buy a Walkman . Can you tell me about the models you have ?
<speaker1> Well , we have a lot of models here.Did you want to listen to CD's or cassettes or the radio ?
<speaker2> Mostly cassette tapes .
<speaker1> Alright . There are several models you may want to look at.This Kreng portable cassette player is very good .
<speaker2> Kreng ? I've never heard of that company .
<speaker1> It's a German company.This unit has auto-reverse , recording capability , and an AM / FM radio band.It also has a built-in microphone .
<speaker2> I suppose I don't want that one then . I don't like auto-reverse . It breaks too easily .
<speaker1> Really ? Have you had an auto-reverse break before ?
<speaker2> Yes , twice now . I think it's too high-tech , and so it's the first part that breaks .
<speaker1> Hmm . You know , the problem might be dust . Did you clean the unit often ?
<speaker2> Well . No , I didn't clean it.But still , I only had the last one two months , and it broke . I don't trust auto-reverse .
<speaker1> Alright . Well . We have many units without auto-reverse.Here is a good unit . Very reliable.It has an AM / FM band , built-in microphone , recording capability , and no auto-reverse .
<speaker2> How much is it ?
<speaker1> This one sells for $ 39.99 .
<speaker2> Can I test it out ?
<speaker1> Of course .
<speaker2> It sounds great . I'll take it .
<speaker1> Fine . I think you'll be happy with it . It's a very good unit . Very reliable . I'll go get you a new one in a box . I will be back in just a moment .
<speaker2> Thanks .

<speaker1> Tell me about yourself .
<speaker2> I was born and raised in Beijing . I attended Peking University and received my bachelor's degree in Economics . I have worked for 2 years as a financial consultant in Beijing for China Pacific Insurance Co . Ltd .
<speaker1> What type of position are you looking for ?
<speaker2> I'm looking for a position in which I can utilize my experience .
<speaker1> Are you interested in a full-time or part-time position ?
<speaker2> I am more interested in a full-time position . However , I would also consider a part-time position .
<speaker1> Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ?
<speaker2> I advised customers on financial matters . After I consulted the customer , I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis .
<speaker1> What is your greatest strength ?
<speaker2> I am an excellent communicator . People trust me and come to me for advice . One afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .
<speaker1> What is your greatest weakness ?
<speaker2> I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . However , I began setting time-limits for myself .
<speaker1> Why do you want to work for our company ?
<speaker2> After following your firm's progress for the last 3 years , I am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and I would like to be a part of that team .
<speaker1> When can you begin ?
<speaker2> Immediately .

<speaker1> Please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules .
<speaker2> Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things .
<speaker1> What are they ?
<speaker2> They are keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
<speaker1> And what is the most important point ?
<speaker2> You should always remember that one customer one file is the rule .

<speaker1> Yeah , look at all those new buildings going up ! Mr . Zhang , the traffic is pretty smooth . But we were told the roads from the airport to downtown were quite crowded and traffic jams could be as long as half an hour .
<speaker2> Yes , they were . But it has already past . The traffic from the airport to downtown has been relieved after the completion of Yan'an Aerial Road .
<speaker1> We've never expected that Shanghai is such a big metropolis , same as New York city . David , would it be a good idea to rent a car here ? I've got an international driver's license with a pretty good record in the States .
<speaker2> That's wonderful . OK . I'll remember that . But I have to warn you that you must drive very carefully in the downtown area , for there're no separate lanes for motor vehicles and bicycles in some places , and still quite a few people don't take road regulations seriously .

<speaker1> This house is not looking all that great from here
<speaker2> You can
<speaker1> s go inside .
<speaker2> I don
<speaker1> s go check it out .
<speaker2> The kitchen may be large , but it doesn
<speaker1> s go look at another house .

<speaker1> Excuse me , waiter , I would like to have some wine before the main course .
<speaker2> Have you decided what wine you would like ?
<speaker1> I have no idea . Maybe you can give me some advice .
<speaker2> I recommend you the white wine . It will wake up your appetite .
<speaker1> That's great , bring me a bottle of that please .

<speaker1> Come on ! It's time to go !
<speaker2> Wait a minute ! Just hold your horses ! What's your hurry , anyway ?
<speaker1> Well , I've got to stop and get gas in the car , first .
<speaker2> That won't take long .
<speaker1> Well , it won't if there no line at the pump .
<speaker2> Well , I'm not quite ready .
<speaker1> I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you !
<speaker2> You wouldn't do a thing like that !
<speaker1> Oh , yes , I would !

<speaker1> I wonder if I can see your mother , little boy . Is she engaged ?
<speaker2> Engaged ? She
<speaker1> d stop reaching for things . Haven

<speaker1> Hello ! Tomorrow I'm going to need a wake-up call .
<speaker2> Not a problem . What time shall we call you ?
<speaker1> I always hit the snooze button , so give me two calls , one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen .
<speaker2> It'll be our pleasure . We'll call you at 7 and then at 7 fifteen .
<speaker1> Oops , cancel that . Change the second call to 7 thirty will you , please ?
<speaker2> No sooner said than done . Can I help you with anything else ?

<speaker2> Okay , sir . Have a pleasant evening .

<speaker1> Have you seen our new packing specifications ?
<speaker2> Yes , I have , Mr . Thomas . We'll pack them two dozen to one carton , and the gross weight is around 25 kilos a carton .

<speaker2> Take it easy.you ' Ve made enough preparations .
<speaker1> I'm in such a need of the job that I can't afford any mistakes .
<speaker2> I'm sure you'll pass it .

<speaker1> Do you think my briefcase is big enough to put in all these stuff ?
<speaker2> Let me see . Laptop , flash disk , a ballpoint pen , a pencil , a notebook , a pair of glasses , cell phone , charger , moisture lotion , ... Oh , that is too much . You are not going to a business trip .
<speaker1> I guess I need all of them .
<speaker2> Actually , the company will provide you with all of these supplies . So , you can leave this very thick notebook at home .
<speaker1> I know . But it is my lucky charm . I carry it all the time .
<speaker2> Suit yourself . Don

<speaker1> May I know where you are going ?
<speaker2> Yes . I want to go to Beijing Hotel .
<speaker1> I'm sorry . You are going in the wrong direction .
<speaker2> Oh no ! What shall I do ?
<speaker1> Don't worry . You can get off at the next stop and go across the street through the overpass . The bus stop is right there .
<speaker2> Thank you very much .
<speaker1> My pleasure .

<speaker1> Steven , shall we go shopping tomorrow ?
<speaker2> Hum ... Why not go shopping the day after tomorrow ? Tomorrow is Saturday . I hate all the hustle and bustle of Saturday shopping .
<speaker1> But Sunday is the same with Saturday . If you don ' t mind , that's OK .
<speaker2> Hum.Maybe it will be better . The most important thing is that I can have a day to relax after a week's work .
<speaker1> I see . We will go the day after tomorrow .
<speaker2> By the way , what kind of stores do we need to go ?
<speaker1> I want to buy some clothes in clothing store . When we are going back , go to the butcher's shop and buy some chicken .
<speaker2> Let

<speaker1> Have you seen the tower in front of us . That's the famous Eiffel Tower . It was built in 1889 for the World's Fair .
<speaker2> How tall is this building ?
<speaker1> It stands 320m ( 1050ft ) high and held the record as the world's tallest structure until 1930 .
<speaker2> I have heard its name is connected with someone , is that right ?
<speaker1> Yes , the towel was named after its designer Gustave Eiffel .

<speaker1> Please tell me something about your insurance background .
<speaker2> I majored in international banking at college so I took many insurance courses . And I worked at an insurance company for my graduation field work .
<speaker1> Why do you want to be an insurance agent ?
<speaker2> I care about people and I know the importance of insurance .
<speaker1> Do you have any work experience in promotion ?
<speaker2> Yes , I do . I have worked as a salesman for P & G Company Ltd .
<speaker1> Do people respond well to you ?
<speaker2> Yes , I'm good with people .

<speaker1> Ah , here we are .
<speaker2> This is the place I was telling you about .
<speaker1> Would you like to sit near the window ?
<speaker2> Good .
<speaker1> Let's have a look at the menu . Oh , there isn't a menu . Do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu ?
<speaker2> Yes , of course . Excuse me . Could you possibly let us see your menu ? Oh . They haven't got one either .

<speaker1> Are you going to buy a bicycle ?
<speaker2> I
<speaker1> s too expensive . Can you give me a better price ?
<speaker2> Your discount is already included . Normally we charge ¥ 400 , but now we can give you a special price . This is our sale period .
<speaker1> It
<speaker2> t you make it any cheaper than that ?
<speaker1> Sorry , but this is the best price . You can
<speaker2> s checks ?
<speaker1> I'm afraid you can ' t . You ' re welcome to pay in cash .

<speaker1> Do you have a free moment ?
<speaker2> Sure . What do you need ?
<speaker1> I'm having some trouble . How do you use this printer ?
<speaker2> Well , first you have to turn this switch on .
<speaker1> Silly me .
<speaker2> Now press this button .
<speaker1> Oh , and it's out of paper . Do you have any more ?
<speaker2> Just a second . I'll go get some .

<speaker1> I need help using the washer and dryer .
<speaker2> Tell me what the problem is .
<speaker1> I can't figure out how to turn them on .
<speaker2> Do you have some quarters ?
<speaker1> I didn't know I needed change .
<speaker2> The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar .
<speaker1> Where do I put the change ?
<speaker2> The quarters go into the slot . You have to push the slot in , and the machine will turn on .
<speaker1> Is that everything that I have to do ?
<speaker2> That's all there is .
<speaker1> I appreciate you helping me with this .
<speaker2> If you need anything else , just let me know .

<speaker1> Do you have any questions ?
<speaker2> Yes , do I have to work a whole year before I can take a vacation ?
<speaker1> Yes , after you
<speaker2> " That
<speaker1> ' What happens if I use up my sick days before the end of the year ? If I ' m sick an extra day or two , will my pay be deducted ? '
<speaker2> s the company policy . "
<speaker1> d be different .

<speaker1> I am absolutely famished .
<speaker2> Yeah . I am too .
<speaker1> Where did you want to go for lunch ?
<speaker2> I was thinking we should just go to the cafeteria .
<speaker1> I don't think I ever got food from the cafeteria .
<speaker2> I actually like the food there .
<speaker1> Does the cafeteria sell a lot of different food ?
<speaker2> They have anything you want .
<speaker1> I was thinking about getting some Chinese food .
<speaker2> I bought some chow mein at the cafeteria . It tasted great .
<speaker1> We can eat at the cafeteria .
<speaker2> I think you'll really like the food there .

<speaker1> Here is the draft contract , Mr . Brown . Let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them . Then I will make out an original of the contract . After that , what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names .
<speaker2> That's OK .
<speaker1> The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective .
<speaker2> Fine . If you'll excuse me , I'd like to go it over first . ( After about 15 minutes ) Hmm , you've done a pretty good job . It's well prepared .
<speaker1> Thank you .
<speaker2> Well , I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time .
<speaker1> That's a good idea .
<speaker2> First , let's read Clause Two about packing . It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . That'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . So , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract .
<speaker1> Agreed .
<speaker2> For shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . So would you allow us to make partial shipments .
<speaker1> I understand your position .

<speaker1> I want to buy a black suit .
<speaker2> Certainty.Do you want double breasted suit or single breasted suit ?
<speaker1> I prefer single breasted suit .
<speaker2> What about this one ? It's a very nice 3 - piece suit .
<speaker1> That looks great . Do you have ties here ?

<speaker1> How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Diane .
<speaker2> How do you do , Jack . Nice to meet you .
<speaker1> Well , I think you ' Ve reconsidered our proposal , Diane .
<speaker2> Yes , you are right . After all , the quality of your air conditioners is good . The only problem is price .
<speaker1> I should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . Do you have any suggestion in mind ? Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable .
<speaker2> That's why I came to your office today . We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 .
<speaker1> That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount .
<speaker2> I see your point . That's to say s 611 each set . Still it's much higher than the market price . Could you see your way to reduce the price , Jack ?
<speaker1> Well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . That's the best we can do . What do you think of that ?
<speaker2> All right . We accept it . So $ 600 for each set .
<speaker1> Very well . Thank you .

<speaker1> Don't I know you ?
<speaker2> I'm not sure.You look familiar .
<speaker1> You're Mr.Stevenson , right ?
<speaker2> Yes.And you're Mr.Jones , I remember .

<speaker1> That's all the general information of our company . I think you already have good knowledge about our company .
<speaker2> Yes , I have an overall understanding .
<speaker1> When we have the final results , we will call you .
<speaker2> Then when will I get a reply at the latest ?
<speaker1> If you pass the interview , the personnel department will inform you within two weeks .
<speaker2> But if I don't pass , will you call me ?
<speaker1> I'm sorry we won't . You can wait for two weeks . If you don't get a telephone call , it means that you weren't successful .
<speaker2> Then do I have the chance to get this job ?
<speaker1> I'm sorry but I can't make the final decision myself , and I have to discuss it with other interviewers .
<speaker2> I know . No matter what the result will be , I have learned a lot from our conversation .
<speaker1> Your mentality is very good and that's great .
<speaker2> Thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview .
<speaker1> My pleasure .

<speaker1> I have a stomachache .
<speaker2> Well , you'd better lie down now . You need a good rest .
<speaker1> All right . I'll do that .

<speaker1> What kind of personality do you think you have ?
<speaker2> I'm quite active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like to leave things half-done .
<speaker1> Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
<speaker2> I'm quite outgoing i think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
<speaker1> What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
<speaker2> I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself I think . A friend in need is a friend in deed.The more really close friends I have , the better .
<speaker1> What kind of people do you like to work with ?
<speaker2> People who are honest , dedicated to their work and having integrity .

<speaker1> I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Monica to our company and introduce her to her department and colleagues . For all of you , we hired Monica because she is a very professional accountant and we are very happy to have her in the finance department . She has lots of working experiences as an accountant and I am sure everybody in the department can benefit from this .
<speaker2> Hello , everybody . I am Monica and this is my first day at work . I am working in the finance department . I am very happy to meet everyone and I am looking forward to working well with all of you . I am very happy to be one of the team and I will do my best to get into the working situation as soon as possible . By the way , call me Monica . Everybody calls me so .

<speaker1> Were you in a leadership position when you were a college student ?
<speaker2> Yes . I was president of the Student Council of our university .
<speaker1> Did you get any honors or awards at your university ?
<speaker2> Yes . I was elected Excellent Party Member for four academic years .
<speaker1> Were you involved in any club activities at your university ?
<speaker2> Yes . I was a member of the Student Poetry Society . I like writing poems in my spare time .
<speaker1> What extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ?
<speaker2> I sometimes played table tennis and sometimes played basketball .

<speaker1> Margaret , I'd like to follow up with the arrangements for our company retreat , to take place next month . We need to book the venue , make arrangements for speakers and door prizes , and set up all the activities and accommodations . Also , very important , we need to determine which of our staff will be eligible and will be available to go . We've got to get a head count in order to make reservations .
<speaker2> What's the criteria for staff to attend ? Are we only including our management team in this affair ? Or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ?
<speaker1> Lower level employees need not attend . The purpose of this retreat is for training , especially for our management team . We want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level . In order to get everyone to jell together , we've got to include some fun . That's the reason for the retreat .

<speaker1> I think Yoga might be suitable for me .
<speaker2> Why ?
<speaker1> Because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
<speaker2> But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too .
<speaker1> I don't know . I just need to try it once . I'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight .
<speaker2> You should try swimming then . It helps you to keep fit .

<speaker1> We are looking for a bilingual secretary . Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English ?
<speaker2> I think my English is fairly good . As you can see from my CV , I graduated from university with a B . A . degree in English . I studied the English language and English literature systematically .
<speaker1> How are your typing and shorthand skills ?
<speaker2> I can type 80 words a minute , basically no mistake , and can take dictation in English at 120 words per minute .

<speaker1> Are these the clothes you want to have washed ?
<speaker2> Yes . When can I get them back ?
<speaker1> Well , if they are collected right now , you can get them back tonight .
<speaker2> That's fine . By the way , please have that suit dry cleaned .
<speaker1> OK . Please fill in the form first .

<speaker1> What's the matter with me , Doctor ? I feel so tired these days .
<speaker2> Is your blood pressure , I'm afraid . It's far too high .
<speaker1> And what's the cause of that ?
<speaker2> Overwork-amongst other things . You can't work 24 hours a day . You ' Ve got to slow down .
<speaker1> But I can't just slow down .
<speaker2> You've got to , I'm afraid . And look at this . You weigh 200 stones . That's too much for a man of your size .
<speaker1> You mean I've got to lose weight ?
<speaker2> Yes . You've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise .

<speaker1> You are an early bird , Tom . What do you do in the morning then ?
<speaker2> Exercise . The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . We should not pass them up easily . Seize the time and do something useful .
<speaker1> So , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . Where do you exercise ?
<speaker2> Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities .
<speaker1> Do you do the same exercises every day ?
<speaker2> No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park .
<speaker1> Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ?
<speaker2> It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them .
<speaker1> Oh , yes . Singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally .

<speaker1> I want some cosmetics.Could you recommend some ?
<speaker2> I think Pond's is the best .
<speaker1> And they're very dear , too .
<speaker2> They're on special offer today .
<speaker1> Oh , that's ideal .

<speaker1> Steven , I'm going abroad by plane for the first time tomorrow . Can you give me some advice ? And what should I pay attention to ?
<speaker2> First , you should have enough sleep to get over the jet lag before the departure . Most people will suffer from jet lag for a few days after a long flight .
<speaker1> I will go to bed early tonight .
<speaker2> Do you have an airsickness ?
<speaker1> I don't know . But I have a carsickness .
<speaker2> You'd better bring some medicine for airsickness .
<speaker1> Thank you .

<speaker1> Can we choose a time to look at houses together ?
<speaker2> Can you do that in the mornings , or would the afternoons be best ?
<speaker1> Either way is good for me .
<speaker2> There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area . Would that okay with you ?
<speaker1> I can take a little time off of work , or I can go on a weekend , also .
<speaker2> We could meet at the real estate office , or I could pick you up at your home .
<speaker1> I am leaving from work , so maybe I could just meet you at the first house that we will look at .
<speaker2> I can think of five houses that we should look at . It will take most of the day .
<speaker1> I would like to see as many as possible .
<speaker2> When I have confirmed the times with the owners , I will e-mail you our plans for the day .

<speaker1> Do you have a package tour to Hollywood ?
<speaker2> Yes , here is the table , which plans do you like best ?
<speaker1> The seven-days trip shall be fine . How much is this tour ?
<speaker2> $ 300 .
<speaker1> We will take the trip . Could you give us a pamphlet ?
<speaker2> Here you are .

<speaker1> What
<speaker2> t belong .
<speaker1> What do you mean ?
<speaker2> Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don

<speaker1> Mom , when you come home , please buy a coat , a skirt , a sweater ...
<speaker2> Enough is enough . I know .

<speaker1> Mr.Chen , do you mind if I smoke ?
<speaker2> I'm sorry , Mrs . Lin . We don't allow smoking in the office .

<speaker1> Yes , sir . American breakfast with fried eggs sunny side up . Breakfast juice and black coffee . And my correct , sir ?
<speaker2> Yes , that
<speaker1> s all .
<speaker2> Good morning , sir . I
<speaker1> ll get them for you right away . Would you please sign this bill first ? Thank you , sir .

<speaker1> I'm sorry , but I'm afraid you've dialed the wrong number.There is no Stefan here .
<speaker2> Really ? Are you sure ? I called before and he was there .

<speaker1> I'd like a flower-and-bird painting .
<speaker2> How about this picture of cranes with pine trees ? It was painted by a famous Chinese painter in King Dynasty .
<speaker1> Oh , they look just like live cranes .
<speaker2> And what is more , in traditional Chinese thinking , cranes and pine trees symbolize longevity .

<speaker1> I have to check out now . My name is Ruth Carson . Can I have my bill , please ?
<speaker2> Yes , it's $ 167 .
<speaker1> Thank you .

<speaker1> Well , Mitzuko-san , I hope you like it here . This is my favourite restaurant in Taipei . It reminds me of my youth when I traveled around Europe .
<speaker2> It looks wonderful . Very authentic .
<speaker1> The chef trained in Florence . The pasta is very good here .
<speaker2> OK . So , what can you recommend ?
<speaker1> Hum ... You should try the mushroom fettucine . It's really good .
<speaker2> Is it salty ?
<speaker1> Not at all . It has a very delicate flavor .
<speaker2> What does ' Duppa del Giono ' mean ? I'm sorry I don't know how to pronounce that .

<speaker1> Mr . Crandall , I
<speaker2> t see the value in doing this entire project over from scratch . It would take a lot of work .
<speaker1> That ' s certainly true . But , that ' s what this job is all about , Maria . There's no doubt that this project is unacceptable .

<speaker1> How are you wedding plans going ?
<speaker2> Very well . We started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done . The only thing that isn
<speaker1> re getting married in three weeks . So that should be ok . So , you
<speaker2> Ve taken care of all of that . We decided not to get married in a church though . Neither of us is very religious .
<speaker1> Which hotel will the reception be held at ?
<speaker2> The palace hotel they
<speaker1> m sure they
<speaker2> s and excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .

<speaker1> Well , the wrong information is in my file . I was at a concert Monday night .
<speaker2> Well , your word overrules the file , sir . One moment , please .
<speaker1> I knew you'd see it my way .
<speaker2> Sir , I deleted the $ 10 , but I had to add a $ 2 service charge to your bill .
<speaker1> Am I in the Twilight Zone ? You're charging me for a movie I never saw ?
<speaker2> Please don't blame me , sir . Blame the computer programmer .
<speaker1> This is highway robbery . I've got a good mind to call the police !
<speaker2> If it makes you feel any better , other guests feel the same way .

<speaker1> Mr . Carter has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the Shangri-La Hotel at 7:00 this evening . Here's an invitation for you .

<speaker1> I'm going to go shopping for groceries in a little bit .
<speaker2> Why , do we need groceries ?
<speaker1> I believe we are all out of food .
<speaker2> Do you know what to get ?
<speaker1> I don't know what we need .
<speaker2> Why don't you go and check the refrigerator ?
<speaker1> I would appreciate it if you would do that for me .
<speaker2> Why don't you just get the basics ?
<speaker1> What do you mean ?
<speaker2> Eggs , milk , bread . Things like that .
<speaker1> Go make that list .
<speaker2> Sure , no problem .

<speaker1> Were you able to attend Friday night's basketball game ?
<speaker2> I was unable to make it .
<speaker1> You should have been there . It was intense .
<speaker2> Is that right . Who ended up winning ?
<speaker1> Our team was victorious .
<speaker2> I wish I was free that night . I'm kind of mad that I didn't go .
<speaker1> It was a great game .
<speaker2> What was the score at the end of the game ?
<speaker1> Our team won 101-98 .
<speaker2> Sounds like it was a close game .
<speaker1> That's the reason it was such a great game .
<speaker2> The next game , I will definitely be there .

<speaker1> Have you ever tried shopping online ?
<speaker2> No , never . I prefer to actually see and touch what I'm buying before I pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes .
<speaker1> That's right . Seeing is believing .
<speaker2> I've heard some friends say when they get the article , it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement .
<speaker1> That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear .
<speaker2> What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password .
<speaker1> It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough .
<speaker2> I can't agree more . that's why I only do street shopping .
<speaker1> Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping .
<speaker2> That's a good idea .

<speaker1> How long does it take to get to downtown from here ?
<speaker2> It is 15 minutes

<speaker2> Yes . That
<speaker1> m sorry , Mr . Richard . Mr . Johnson is on his way to the office . He had just called and asked you to wait a minute .
<speaker2> Well , I
<speaker1> s anything else you
<speaker2> t hesitate to tell me .
<speaker1> Thank you very much .

<speaker1> 911 . How may I help you ?
<speaker2> I need to report a break-in .
<speaker1> When did this break-in occur ?
<speaker2> Last night .
<speaker1> Where did the break-in happen ?
<speaker2> It happened at my house .
<speaker1> Was anything taken ?
<speaker2> I'm not sure yet .
<speaker1> What makes you think there was a break-in ?
<speaker2> My front window was busted .
<speaker1> I'll send a squad car .
<speaker2> Please hurry .

<speaker1> Good morning , everyone . Let me introduce myself to you ...
<speaker2> You don't need to introduce yourself , Yang . You're famous .
<speaker1> Well , thank you very much but I thought l'd try and chair the meeting by the rule — at least for a while .
<speaker2> OK , OK !
<speaker1> Now , I'd like to get things under way . The main topic on today's agenda is the development of a U . S . sales strategy for the new EBB . I'd like to hear all of your ideas , Mr . Wall , you seem in top form today . Could you start the ball rolling ?
<speaker2> Uh , oh , sure . Well , I think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising .
<speaker1> Well , that's kind of obvious .
<speaker2> Give me a break , Mr Yang .
<speaker1> Uh , let's keep this going , shall we ?

<speaker1> I'm sorry , but I don't think this damage is our fault .
<speaker2> What do you mean ?
<speaker1> It looks like the shipping company did this .
<speaker2> We'd better take it up with them , in that case .

<speaker1> I
<speaker2> t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely !
<speaker1> No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let
<speaker2> re offering .
<speaker1> Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They
<speaker2> t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
<speaker1> That
<speaker2> Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one !
<speaker1> Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ...
<speaker2> Unique , aren
<speaker1> Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one
<speaker2> s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ?

<speaker1> I believe we met at a concert last year . I'm Taylor .
<speaker2> Oh , yes . I remember .

<speaker1> Lucy , I
<speaker2> d better call the repair man to do it .
<speaker1> I think I can handle it by myself .
<speaker2> I
<speaker1> t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
<speaker2> Other company rules also need your attention .
<speaker1> Like this one ? Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder.Yeah , thank you for telling me .
<speaker2> Don

<speaker1> Thank God ! I am finished writing that service guide ! It took me forever !
<speaker2> When did you finish ?
<speaker1> This morning ! No more overtime , and no more headaches !
<speaker2> Well , I

<speaker1> I didn
<speaker2> t be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it .
<speaker1> I will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem .
<speaker2> You can

<speaker1> I should tell you that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes .
<speaker2> I'm ready when you are , sir .
<speaker1> Very good ! Now , it's still morning here in New York .
<speaker2> You are so right , sir . The clock just struck nine .
<speaker1> I'm going to spend some time exploring the city . What can I do with my luggage ?
<speaker2> Sir , right here we have a storage site . Its only $ 5 an hour , but you need to leave a deposit .

<speaker1> Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO
<speaker2> t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine .
<speaker1> I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
<speaker2> Not in a million years !

<speaker2> This one is 1500 yuan .
<speaker1> It looks pretty good . I think I'll take it .
<speaker2> Would you like anything else ?
<speaker1> That's all thank you .

<speaker1> I need something to wash this down . Is there any juice in the fridge ?
<speaker2> What is that ? It looks like something from a swamp !
<speaker1> It's a green drink . It's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals .
<speaker2> You know , healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag .
<speaker1> The sales lady said that even if I eat right , I wouldn't get enough vitamins .
<speaker2> Have you ever tried it ? Or are you just going to believe the sales lady ?
<speaker1> It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day .
<speaker2> It may take less time , but I don't know about easier . Yuck .

<speaker1> Billy , you are late again .
<speaker2> I'm sorry I'm late . I overslept . Is the manager here today ?
<speaker1> Yes he ' s in his office .
<speaker2> Oh , I hope he didn't notice me .
<speaker1> Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you .
<speaker2> You said it . It won't happen again . Do you really think he'd fire me ?
<speaker1> I think he might . You'd better go to his office .
<speaker2> You are probably right . I'll go right now and apologize . I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic .
<speaker1> Good luck !

<speaker1> How much is the rent ?
<speaker2> The rent is $ 1500 per month .
<speaker1> And how much is the deposit ?
<speaker2> The deposit is $ 500 .

<speaker1> Is there anything else , apart from the Credit Rating and Debt to Asset Ratio ?
<speaker2> There is the Balance of Net Liabilities . This must not exceed its net assets and no business loss can be shown during the past two years .
<speaker1> Right , OK . That , again , shouldn't be a problem .
<speaker2> And the total ratio of return on assets should not be lower than the average , for that particular industry , for the first two quarters of the year .
<speaker1> Well , as far as I can tell , we qualify .
<speaker2> Of course we will need proof , originals and duplicate of everything . As soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it , it should be very quick indeed .

<speaker1> Do you understand any other foreign languages besides English ?
<speaker2> Yes , I know a little about Japanese which is similar to Chinese not only in culture but in language itself .
<speaker1> What band did you pass in Japanese Language Proficiency Test ?
<speaker2> I passed the Band two in LPT , but I will try to achieve Band one which is the highest level .

<speaker2> Yes , I do .
<speaker1> According to the regulations , the camera you've brought along for personal use can be passed for the time being duty free , but you will have to take it out with you when you leave the country .
<speaker2> I will .
<speaker1> Well . Have a pleasant stay in Germany .
<speaker2> Thank you .

<speaker1> Hi , Sam . I want to buy a pet . Do you have any ideas ?
<speaker2> You really should go to Rachel's pet store .
<speaker1> Why ? anything special there ?
<speaker2> It's more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more .
<speaker1> Oh , really ? are there any snakes ?
<speaker2> Snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets .
<speaker1> That's terrific . I can't wait to check it out .
<speaker2> Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ?
<speaker1> Why not ? it's so cool .
<speaker2> But it will pose a risk to your health .
<speaker1> Pardon ?
<speaker2> I mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems .
<speaker1> Well , I didn't realize that .
<speaker2> I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .
<speaker1> Oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .
<speaker2> Yes , good luck , Maria .

<speaker1> Hello , this is room 1205 . Our message lamp is flashing .
<speaker2> Hold on a minute , please .
<speaker1> Thank you .
<speaker2> I am sorry to have kept you waiting . Mr . Johns needs a telephone call from you .
<speaker1> Would you bring the message to my room .
<speaker2> I'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment .
<speaker1> Then I'll come down and pick up the message immediately .
<speaker2> OK , we wait for you .

<speaker1> guess what ? I've got great news !
<speaker2> what is it ?
<speaker1> well , you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader , right ?
<speaker2> yes .
<speaker1> well , the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him .
<speaker2> really ? That's fantastic ! Will you get a chance to do any writing ?
<speaker1> she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back .
<speaker2> wow ! That's really great news . How often does the magazine come out ?
<speaker1> it's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly .
<speaker2> are you looking forward to doing more editing work ?
<speaker1> yes , but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again !
<speaker2> do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine ?
<speaker1> I don't have any with me , but I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you .
<speaker2> I'm really looking forward to reading your column .
<speaker1> me , too . Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ?
<speaker2> sure , where would you like to go ?
<speaker1> perhaps we could go to the library festival that's going on at the local bookshop .

<speaker1> have you seen the new Cosmo magazine that I was reading this morning ?
<speaker2> I think I may have seen it on the kitchen table .
<speaker1> you're right , thanks . There's an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that I want to finish .
<speaker2> who's the director ?
<speaker1> it's Martin Scorsese . You liked his film , The Departed , didn't you ?
<speaker2> yes , it was fantastic ! Can I read the article when you're finished ?
<speaker1> sure . You know it has an online edition , too . You should go online to read if you want to read it now .
<speaker2> that's ok . I'll wait until you're finished . Just out of curiosity , do you have a subscription for that magadize ?
<speaker1> no . I don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile .
<speaker2> how much does the magadize cost ?
<speaker1> it's almost three pounds now , and I think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon .
<speaker2> that's quite expensive . Who is their target audience ?
<speaker1> Cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership , but I think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore .
<speaker2> I bet you'll still buy it , though . You wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine !

<speaker1> Wei ! This is a first-you didn't bargain !
<speaker2> Bargain ? I'd feel way too guilty .
<speaker1> But you could have saved money .
<speaker2> From a sweet ma ? ! It's not worth it . Plus , I'd happily pay more for these things I bought !
<speaker1> F . Y . I . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you're done ...
<speaker2> Ha ! I'm just warming up ! Please take me there now !

<speaker1> Can you help me do an internet search ?
<speaker2> Sure . What do you want to find ?
<speaker1> I want to find information on the American Civil War .
<speaker2> Well , can you be more specific ? There are a lot of websites about that .
<speaker1> Yes , I want to know about the battle of Gettysburg .
<speaker2> O . K . Well , go to google.com , and type in “ Battle of Gettysburg . ”
<speaker1> Oh wow , there are a lot of sites .
<speaker2> Here , try this one . It
<speaker1> m interested , I

<speaker1> I just have to come up for air . I
<speaker2> d better come back in two hours .

<speaker1> Good afternoon . I'd like to speak with Tom Smith .
<speaker2> I'm afraid he's away from his desk at the moment .
<speaker1> Do you know when he will be back ?
<speaker2> He's away on a business trip . He won't be back until some time next week .
<speaker1> Is there some way I can get into contact with him ?
<speaker2> The best way to reach him is by cell phone . I'll give you his number .
<speaker1> Thanks . And could I have his e-mail , just in case I can't get him by phone ?
<speaker2> Sure . His cell phone is 09112223 33 . And his e-mail is lower case t , smith--that's one word , at , c , c , w , dot , com , dot , t , w .

<speaker2> Try to get outdoors more and be sure to get more rest .
<speaker1> Thank you , doctor . I'll do as you say .

<speaker1> Are you serious ?
<speaker2> I was there .
<speaker1> What happened ?
<speaker2> A man came into the bank with a gun .
<speaker1> That's insane .
<speaker2> I was so scared when I saw the gun .
<speaker1> Then what happened ?
<speaker2> He took the money and tried to get away .
<speaker1> Did the cops show up in time ?
<speaker2> He didn't even make it out the door .

<speaker1> hello ! What are you reading about in the newspaper ?

<speaker2> m so happy for the family ! They must be very relieved and excited about that .
<speaker1> I
<speaker2> m so jealous ! I wish it were me ! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I
<speaker1> t even won a small prize yet . It
<speaker2> t be moody ! I hope you
<speaker1> Ve been invited to a party this evening . I know how excited you get about parties .

<speaker1> How much is it all together ?
<speaker2> Let me see . The bell-bottom pants are $ 90 and the coat is $ 120 . It comes to $ 210 .
<speaker1> Is it possible for you to reduce the price ?
<speaker2> I am sorry . It's a one-price shop .

<speaker1> You look fresh recently.How do you make it ?
<speaker2> I attend an aerobic class three times a week .
<speaker1> Aren't you tired ?
<speaker2> No , I feel young , fresh and energetic .

<speaker1> Hello , this is Liu Juan speaking . Is that Mr . Brown ?
<speaker2> No , this isn't .
<speaker1> Could you please get him on the phone ?
<speaker2> Sure . Wait a minute .

<speaker1> It's especially cold when the wind is blowing .
<speaker2> Why don't you wear a scarf ?
<speaker1> What can wearing one do for me ?
<speaker2> You're cold because the wind is blowing into your open collar . It's not because your jacket isn't thick enough .
<speaker1> So wearing a scarf helps your body to stay warm inside your jacket .
<speaker2> Yes . That's the secret to wearing a thin jacket .
<speaker1> You know , sometimes I can't feel my ears and fingers .
<speaker2> I'll lend you my gloves and earmuffs until you get your own .
<speaker1> Thanks , Pam . You're my lifesaver .

<speaker1> Hey , could you help me try and figure out how to get ready for my job interview ?

<speaker1> Yes , I pretty much understand the company .
<speaker2> Well , after you've done your research , you have to decide whether the company is casual or formal . Have you decided what they are yet ?
<speaker1> Yes , I've been observing them .
<speaker2> When you are choosing what to wear , keep all of that in mind . Have you chosen what to wear ?
<speaker1> I already have something to wear .
<speaker2> I would always be ready to go shopping with you ! Should we talk about other basics ?
<speaker1> OK , I am ready to think of other things .
<speaker2> You need to make sure you arrive on time , smile , be pleasant and friendly , look the person in the eye and answer all questions to the best of your ability . You'll do great !

<speaker1> Is there anything I can do for you ?
<speaker2> Would you please show me that mural ?
<speaker1> Certainly . Here you are .

<speaker2> My parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
<speaker1> Oh dear . Well , I suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? It seems a bit dusty in here .

<speaker2> s very nice of you to offer . Here
<speaker1> s still quite hot .

<speaker1> my lease ends next month , so I have to find a new place .
<speaker2> I feel sorry for you . It's a jungle out there .
<speaker1> Do you know any places ?
<speaker2> well . I guess I can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available .
<speaker1> thank you . I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet .
<speaker2> how much do are you looking to spend ?
<speaker1> I can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month .
<speaker2> looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs .
<speaker1> it doesn't matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route .
<speaker2> anything you need to have in the place ?
<speaker1> I want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side .
<speaker2> you can also check out university bulletin boards .
<speaker1> why ? Will those be students who are leaving ?
<speaker2> not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent .
<speaker1> thank you . I'll be sure to take a look .
<speaker2> good luck .

<speaker1> Good afternoon , how may I help you ?

<speaker1> Do you know what kind of flowers she likes ?
<speaker2> I'm not sure . I know I should know that , but I can't remember right now .
<speaker1> Well , they're for your wife , so I think you should give her roses .
<speaker2> Roses will be fine .
<speaker1> What color ?
<speaker2> I think red would be nice .
<speaker1> Do you want to pick them up or should we deliver them ?
<speaker2> Can you deliver them , please ?
<speaker1> What's the address ?
<speaker2> 241 Main street .

<speaker1> What do you think I should do , doctor ?
<speaker2> Why don't you try Chinese herbal medicine ?
<speaker1> Is it useful for me ?
<speaker2> You have to try at least .
<speaker1> OK . Thanks a lot .
<speaker2> That's nothing .

<speaker1> What do you need today ?
<speaker2> I need to take a few classes .
<speaker1> What kind of classes would you like to take ?
<speaker2> How about a driver's course ?
<speaker1> Okay , you're going to need to make an appointment .
<speaker2> I don't understand why I need to make an appointment .

<speaker1> Well , tell me something of yourself .
<speaker2> What would you like to know , Mr . Green ?
<speaker1> What working experience have you get ?
<speaker2> In 2004 , I got a job in the sales department of a trading company near Guangzhou . I started a sales representative . A year later , I was promoted to the position of sales manager . I had that job ever since , which is just over a year now .
<speaker1> Oh , good . Irene , can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant ? Don't you like your present job ?
<speaker2> Frankly , some part of it I enjoy very much , but I prefer something more professional . It happens that I have a friend working here in this company . She told me the export department was to recruit an assistant . I felt very excited at this news . That's why I'm here .

<speaker1> This looks wonderful , Madame Culot .
<speaker2> Yes , it's very nice . All our foreign visitors enjoy it . The food is wonderfully well-prepared . Let me know if you need any help with the menu .
<speaker1> Thank you . Mmm . Can you tell me about the terrine ?
<speaker2> Yes . A terrine is a kind of meat pate . It's meat turned into a paste . It sounds horrible but it's actually really good .
<speaker1> Mmm . Maybe another time .
<speaker2> You could try the ravioli . They are rather like your Chinese dumplings , and the sauce is delicious .
<speaker1> Sounds good . I think I'll have the lamb for my main course . What does it come with ?
<speaker2> Well , you can have fries-French fries-or simple boiled potatoes .
<speaker1> I'll have the potatoes . What are you having ?
<speaker2> I'm having my usual . I like the fish here . Would you like some wine ?
<speaker1> Oh , yes . That would be lovely .

<speaker1> Hi , could we have two orange juice smoothies ?
<speaker2> Would you like those with yogurt ?

<speaker2> It
<speaker1> s good for you !

<speaker1> Wow , Amy , look at that number .
<speaker2> What's so great about it ?
<speaker1> What do you mean ? It's a scrim .
<speaker2> Not to me , I wouldn't be caught dead in that .
<speaker1> I love that kind of stuff .
<speaker2> Yeah , you seem to like those styles .
<speaker1> Sure do . I get a kick out of looking punk .

<speaker1> So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ...
<speaker2> No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased .
<speaker1> How many people are on the board of directors ?
<speaker2> Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . They meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . They provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line .

<speaker1> How much will my pay be , if you don
<speaker2> t give bonus every month , but we offer a semi-annual bonus . And you will receive two weeks paid vacation a year , as well . Does it suit you ?
<speaker1> Yes , thank you . May I ask for an apartment ?
<speaker2> No problem . We'll supply you with an apartment of two bedrooms and a living room .

<speaker1> Mum , can I finish my homework later ?
<speaker2> Sorry . You know the rules .
<speaker1> But I want to watch TV now .
<speaker2> That
<speaker1> s impossible .

<speaker1> Where
<speaker2> s in the garden , Jane .
<speaker1> What

<speaker1> Is Tim in the garden , too ?
<speaker2> Yes , he is . He
<speaker1> s climbing the tree .
<speaker2> Tim is .
<speaker1> What about the dog ?
<speaker2> The dog
<speaker1> s running across the grass . It

<speaker1> What's wrong with you ?
<speaker2> I have a sore throat and headache .
<speaker1> Do you feel tired ?
<speaker2> Yes , my whole body feels weak . And I really feel terrible .

<speaker2> Sure . I'll give you the next size up . That one is small , right ?
<speaker1> Yes . Also , I'm not so sure about the color .
<speaker2> Well.It doesn't go with your skirt . I think the color itself is fine though .

<speaker1> Are you going to vote ?

<speaker2> How is that ?
<speaker1> You can use it however many times you need to .
<speaker2> Is that right ?
<speaker1> Yup , and you can keep the money in your pocket .

<speaker1> You should go get yours .
<speaker2> Yeah , I think I will .

<speaker2> I love it . I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it.It gives me a real sense of satisfaction.Do you enjoy cooking ?
<speaker1> I don
<speaker2> t stand doing the washing up , drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
<speaker1> You can ask the guests for help . My guests usually insist on doing the washing up . I just have to remind them where everything goes .

<speaker1> Italian , Indian and chinese . I
<speaker2> m cooking.But I

<speaker2> You came to the right place . Any particular decade ?
<speaker1> If you had a box made in the ' 20s , that would be nice .
<speaker2> We just got one in yesterday , so now we have six .
<speaker1> Would any of them have dancing figures ?
<speaker2> Yes , we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures .
<speaker1> Oh , they're both so beautiful . Let me have this one , I think .
<speaker2> That one truly is a beautiful piece of work , isn't it ?
<speaker1> One last question
<speaker2> Oh , no . Everything we sell here is " as is . "

<speaker1> John , I was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year .
<speaker2> I've already told my buddy , Mark , that I am going hunting with him in Alaska .
<speaker1> You can't be serious !
<speaker2> Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you .
<speaker1> After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together .
<speaker2> Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case .
<speaker1> You know , now that I think about it , I really don't have much more to say to you at all !
<speaker2> Whatever you say !

<speaker1> Have you declared your income and are you prepared to pay tax ?
<speaker2> Not yet . I don't know how to fill out the form . What is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ?
<speaker1> I don't really know . Why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? They will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation . He can even help you avoid paying tax legally .
<speaker2> If I don't pay my taxes , would the tax officials discover it ?
<speaker1> Certainly . No one who evades tax can escape from their detection.They ' ll check your income through computers . You'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . If you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined .

<speaker1> What's up ? You sound a little down in dumps .

<speaker1> t do this to you . "
<speaker2> " Hold it , Mike . You won
<speaker1> ' What would you do if you were in my shoes ? '
<speaker2> t mean to quarrel with him . "
 " No way , Kate . I mean it
<speaker1> t hurt much to say sorry first . And after that , you can casually mention the problem . I am sure he will cooperate . "

<speaker2> I think so . Could I have you name , telephone number ? If we get one , I will call you .
<speaker1> That's terrific . Thank you .

<speaker1> Who do you think is the greatest novelist in the history of English literature ?
<speaker2> Charles Dickens.Actually no one can parallel him in writing .

<speaker2> Any idea when he might be back ?

<speaker1> Tell me about yourself and your past experience .
<speaker2> I have worked as an executive secretary for 5 years , first for trading companies , and now I am working for a trust company . I interact well with peers , clients , administrators and bosses . I thrive on challenge and work well in high-stress environments .
<speaker1> How are your typing and shorthand skills ?
<speaker2> I can type 100 Chinese words a minute and take dictation in English at 150 words a minute .
<speaker1> Can you operate computers skillfully ?
<speaker2> Yes , I can . I have received some special training in computers . Besides I am good at operating common office machines , such as fax machines and duplicating machines .
<speaker1> Sometimes we are very busy and need to work overtime . How do you feel about that ?
<speaker2> That's all right . But could you tell me how often and how many hours I should work overtime ?
<speaker1> It just depends . If we have important visiting delegations , you have to stay with us . It's not unusual .
<speaker2> Mr . Smith , I's like to ask you a question .
<speaker1> OK , please .
<speaker2> What specific duties would I perform if I am hired ?
<speaker1> Nothing different from a secretary's common responsibilities . However , you know , our company is an international trade-oriented company , can you handle English papers and write English correspondence ?
<speaker2> Yes . I specialized in English secretary studies at college and that's one of the main parts of my present job .
<speaker1> What are your salary expectations ?
<speaker2> I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . Maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position .
<speaker1> The starting monthly salary would be ¥ 2,000 , with rises after the half year according to your competence .
<speaker2> I think it's acceptable and I really like the job . And when can I know the decision ?
<speaker1> We'll inform you of our final decision by early July . Do you have any other questions ?
<speaker2> No . Thank you for the time .

<speaker1> What do you think about the equipment in our company ?
<speaker2> We have to equip our company with a network of work stations at every office and show room as soon as possible .
<speaker1> I also realized this issue . And office automation is essential .
<speaker2> Besides , Internet tends to be more essential now in the information age .
<speaker1> Good idea . A network of work stations is helpful for our management .
<speaker2> And , to be frank , our copying machines are too slow ; our telephone system is limited in function .
<speaker1> You are right . The current equipment of our offices really falls behind . Next week , you can provide me a catalogue of new equipment .

<speaker1> Thank your for calling World Airline . What can I do for you ?
<speaker2> I need to book a plane ticket to London .

<speaker2> Saturday , July 25 .
<speaker1> How many people will be traveling ?
<speaker2> Just one adult .
<speaker1> Which class ?
<speaker2> Economy , please . Economy class is the cheapest , right ?
<speaker1> Right . Ok , the fare is $ 700 .

<speaker1> Hello , the nurse said that you might have my test results in from the other day .
<speaker2> I would like for you to come in and talk about a few more tests that I would like to run .
<speaker1> Does this mean that you have bad news for me ?
<speaker2> I just want to talk to you about the tests that I want to run .
<speaker1> Can
<speaker2> t know anything for certain . We always do a double check if there is a question .
<speaker1> I want to see you right away .
<speaker2> You can come in this afternoon . If you are feeling too stressed , feel free to bring a friend along .
<speaker1> I know for sure that something is wrong !
<speaker2> Don

<speaker1> You would be using mainly English in this job . Do you think you could manage ?
<speaker2> Yes , I am sure I can .
<speaker1> Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English ?
<speaker2> Yes , I think I am quite proficient in both written and spoken English .
<speaker1> Do you think you can make yourself understood in English with ease ?
<speaker2> Yes , I think I can in ordinary circumstances .
<speaker1> Do you think you can speak English quite fluently ? Tell me about your English education .
<speaker2> Yes , I think I speak English quite fluently . I got a high score on TOEFL . I majored in English in college .

<speaker1> You are looking really healthy lately . What are you doing differently ?
<speaker2> Thank you for noticing ! I've been making a few lifestyle changes over the past year .
<speaker1> Tell me about it . I'm interested .
<speaker2> Well , it all started when my brother challenged me to quit smoking .
<speaker1> Ha ! That's right . You used to smoke . I forgot !
<speaker2> When I kicked that habit , I found I had so much more energy . I started exercising .
<speaker1> At the gym ?
<speaker2> No . I like to be outside . I took up hiking and mountain biking .

<speaker1> Good morning . My name is Mr . Brown . I
<speaker2> m pleased to meet you , Mr . Brown . My name is Kathy Pewless , the representative of Green Textile Import and Export Corporation .
<speaker1> Pleased to meet you too , Ms . Pewless . I travel a lot every year on business , but this is my first visit to your country . I must say I have been much impressed by your friendly people .
<speaker2> Thank you for saying so . Have you seen the exhibition halls ? On display are most of our products , such as silk , woolen knitwear , cotton piece goods , and garments .
<speaker1> Oh , yes . I had a look yesterday . I found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . I
<speaker2> Ve got some idea of your exports . I
<speaker1> Ve met with great favor overseas and are always in great demand .

<speaker1> Can you help me plan the office party ?
<speaker2> Sure . What do you need the most help with , the food or entertainment ?
<speaker1> I need help with food .
<speaker2> OK , well , let's coordinate our efforts . Should this party be formal or casual ?
<speaker1> I think it should be casual .
<speaker2> I agree . Next , we have to decide on food . We have a choice of Chinese or Continental Cuisine . Which one should we have ?
<speaker1> I would prefer Chinese food for this party .
<speaker2> Perfect choice . For music , should we have a live band or a DJ ?
<speaker1> I think we should hire a live band .
<speaker2> OK then . Well , I will work on my part and get back to you with my progress on Friday .

<speaker1> Good morning . Thank you for the interview .
<speaker2> No problem . Now , do you prefer working with others or flying solo ?
<speaker1> Actually , I enjoy both .
<speaker2> So , what is most important to you in a job ? Do you need job security or professional growth and a chance to advance ?
<speaker1> I need job security .
<speaker2> Would you be able to relocate ?
<speaker1> I am open to relocating .
<speaker2> What are your annual salary requirements ?
<speaker1> I need at least 75,000 per year .
<speaker2> I
<speaker1> ll be in touch .

<speaker1> Is the right counter to check in for this flight ?
<speaker2> Yes , it is . Please put your luggage on this scale .
<speaker1> OK . Is the plane on schedule ?
<speaker2> Yes , it is . How many pieces of hand luggage do you have ?
<speaker1> Two .

<speaker1> I'm looking for a good multivitamin . Can you recommend one ?
<speaker2> Yes . Come with me to the vitamin section .
<speaker1> I knew there would be a few choices , but this selection is huge !
<speaker2> You're looking for a multi though , right ?
<speaker1> That's right . Just a simple multi-vitamin that I can take every day .
<speaker2> Okay . Then I recommend this one . It's made especially for men about your age .
<speaker1> Oh ! You took the guesswork right out of that one .
<speaker2> That's my job ! Is there anything else I can assist you with ?

<speaker1> I only want a little off the top and the sides and back to have clean lines .
<speaker2> Okay . Is your hair naturally curly or is it a perm ?
<speaker1> It's natural . My friend told me you know how to work with curls .
<speaker2> That's my specialty . Let me put this around your neck .
<speaker1> Do you have any product that controls frizz ?
<speaker2> With the cut I'll give you , we will minimize a lot of that .
<speaker1> Thank you !
<speaker2> And when we're done , I'll show you some great stuff to take care of the rest .

<speaker1> Would you pour me some of that tea , please ?
<speaker2> Okay . Say when .

<speaker1> Hey , look , there is a circus show over there .
<speaker2> I'm not in the mood .
<speaker1> It's the circus .
<speaker2> I don't want to sit there and watch them torturing the animals .
<speaker1> Oh , come on , they give them treat too.Oh , look , that little monkey is so cute .
<speaker2> Cute ? Hope so .
<speaker1> Oh , it is coming to us , come on , Ben , get a banana to it .
<speaker2> Me ? No way , keep him away from me , please .
<speaker1> Why are you acting so strange today ?
<speaker2> I've said that I've got a problem with the circus . I'm not kidding .
<speaker1> That's weird !

<speaker1> Now please tell me something about your past work achievements .
<speaker2> All right , madam . When I was sales manager at the Beijing Friendship Store . I succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 % and profit margins from 50 % to 80 % .
<speaker1> That is quite an achievement ! Do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
<speaker2> I don't think so . I'll create further achievement in the future .
<speaker1> Have you received any honors ?
<speaker2> Yes . I got the title of " Advance Worker " in 2006 .
<speaker1> Do you have any publications ?
<speaker2> Yes . I wrote a thesis entitled " On Interpersonal Relations in the Socialist Market Economy " and it was published in China Daily .

<speaker1> Hit ' em high , hit ' em low . Class of ' 93 — let's go !
<speaker2> Hi there , everyone . We hope you're having a good night !
<speaker1> Wasn't that football game great ! I just knew we'd win !
<speaker2> The night is young , folks . Get some food and mingle with those faces from yesterday .
<speaker1> Later we'll let you know who the King and Queen of the Reunion will be .
<speaker2> But for now , the band is playing the songs from our senior year . Get out on that dance floor !

<speaker1> Excuse me . Can you tell me how to get to City Hall ?
<speaker2> Yes . Go to the next corner and turn left onto Center Street . Walk three blocks to Second Avenue and turn right . Walk two more blocks and you'll see City Hall on the left .
<speaker1> I'm sorry . I didn't follow you . Could you please repeat that ?
<speaker2> Okay . First , go to the next corner and turn left onto Center Street .
<speaker1> Uh-huh .
<speaker2> Then , walk three blocks to Second Avenue an turn right . Are you with me so far ?
<speaker1> Yes . I'm following you .
<speaker2> Then , walk two more blocks an you
<speaker1> " Yes . Now I

<speaker1> What's up ?
<speaker2> Nothing much , what's going on ?
<speaker1> I'm having a party this Friday .
<speaker2> Oh , really ? That's nice .
<speaker1> I wanted to see if you wanted to come .
<speaker2> This Friday ? Sorry , I already have plans .
<speaker1> Doing what ?
<speaker2> I'm going to dinner with my family .
<speaker1> I really wanted you to come , but I understand .
<speaker2> Yeah , maybe next time .
<speaker1> I'll hold you to that .
<speaker2> Sounds like a plan .

<speaker1> I find that you spend little on handset charge every month . Have you any trick ?
<speaker2> It's simple . You can use call transfer .
<speaker1> Is it so simple ?
<speaker2> Sure . You know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so I need pay little for receiving calls .
<speaker1> It's true .
<speaker2> Call transfer has many other advantages . When I am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , I also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call .
<speaker1> That's all ?
<speaker2> In hospitals or on planes , handsets will interfere with some equip-ment , so we must close our handsets . If you set call transfer , the problem will be solved .

<speaker1> Are you doing anything tomorrow morning ? I'm wondering if you'd like to come to my office to discuss the new project .
<speaker2> Tomorrow morning ? What about tomorrow afternoon ?
<speaker1> Then I'll see you in the afternoon .
<speaker2> OK .

<speaker1> Hello , I want to apply for the position of an usher in your restaurant .
<speaker2> Welcome . One of your duties is to know the number of the customer and accept reservation .
<speaker1> What else do I need to do ?
<speaker2> You inform the people in charge and let them reserve dinning tables for guests .

<speaker1> I
<speaker2> s no way that I can stay here .
<speaker1> That
<speaker2> t understand why .
<speaker1> I

<speaker1> Because you
<speaker2> re not going to get it .
<speaker1> But I
<speaker2> t help you with that .

<speaker2> Here it is . 350 Yuan all together .

<speaker1> Thank you .

<speaker1> Wow , it's surprising . So what do I get ?
<speaker2> You can have a free facial and then make up free for you . Do you want it now ?
<speaker1> Probably not . Doing that will probably take another three hours which I can't afford now .
<speaker2> Here is our number . Call us when you are ready to come .
<speaker1> You mean I should make an appointment ahead of time ?
<speaker2> Yes .
<speaker1> Got it . Bye for now .

<speaker1> Can I borrow this magazine from you ? It's really interesting and I can't put it down .
<speaker2> I am sorry , but I can't lend it to you now , for I haven't finished reading it . If you don't mind , I can lend you some back numbers to you .
<speaker1> That would be very kind of you . By the way , is it a monthly magazine ?
<speaker2> No , it is a fortnightly . So , you see , I can get the new one quite soon .

<speaker1> How often do you run your anti-virus program ?
<speaker2> I usually run it every few days . It finds a virus about half the time .
<speaker1> Which anti-virus program would you recommend ?
<speaker2> Have you tried this one ? It
<speaker1> ll send you an email with the line in it . It only takes a few minutes to download . Then you have to go through the set up procedures . But they are not complicated .
<speaker2> What do you use your computer for ?
<speaker1> I use it for several things-surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . I don
<speaker2> t they ? I should download some programs and learn how to use them .

<speaker2> Hello , Becky . Well , you see , I have this thing here , called a Fixed Deposit Certificate , and I've just noticed the date on it .
<speaker1> Oh , I see . You have two choices here you can either redeem or renew .
<speaker2> I think I'll redeem , if that's not a problem .
<speaker1> No problem at all , Mr Waterstone . Any preference as to how you want the money ?
<speaker2> Anything you like , but not too many large notes . It's useful to have smaller notes .
<speaker1> Here we go , Mr Waterstone . Here's your money and your interest note .
<speaker2> Yes , yes . Everything's fine . Thank you very much , Becky .

<speaker1> What can I do for you , young man ?
<speaker2> I need to rent three pairs of skates for the morning .
<speaker1> What sizes do you need ?
<speaker2> One pair of 37 , and two pairs of 21 . One for me , and the other two for two kids .
<speaker1> Here you are . And here are three crash helmets .
<speaker2> Thanks . Well , those two kids are beginners . What should I do about their safety ?
<speaker1> Well , there are a lot to do , but nothing to worry about . First , make sure they don't go far from the railings .
<speaker2> Oh , yeah , maybe I should ask them just to walk along the railings .
<speaker1> That's a good idea . And remind them to be slow at the beginning , not to run into the railings .
<speaker2> OK . Anything else ?
<speaker1> Never go to the center of the lake . The ice there is too thin to skate on .
<speaker2> Got it . Thanks for reminding me . And , are there any intensive training courses ?

<speaker1> Excuse me sir . May I come in ?
<speaker2> Mike , you're late again .
<speaker1> I'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so I
<speaker2> Do you think I believe the story like that ?
<speaker1> But it's true .
<speaker2> How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ?
<speaker1> That's coincident 。
<speaker2> Ok , hold it . Remember to be punctual next time 。
<speaker1> I promise I will .
<speaker2> You'd better .

<speaker1> Honey , I have something important to say .
<speaker2> Something important ?
<speaker1> Yes . I have just booked two tickets .
<speaker2> Tickets ? What tickets ?
<speaker1> Two air tickets .
<speaker2> Air tickets ?
<speaker1> Yes . We will fly to Paris the day after tomorrow .
<speaker2> We ? The day after tomorrow ? What are you talking about ?
<speaker1> Today is June 18 , isn
<speaker2> t you remember this important day to us ?
<speaker1> Sorry .
<speaker2> It is our 10th wedding anniversary this June 20 .
<speaker1> Our 10th wedding anniversary ?
<speaker2> Of course . You completely forgot it .
<speaker1> Darling . I think you have made a mistake .
<speaker2> I have made a mistake ?
<speaker1> Yes . We married on July 20 ten years ago .
<speaker2> July 20 ? But I think it should be June 20 .
<speaker1> Yes . We had planned to marry on June 20 , but something happened , so we had to put off our wedding day .
<speaker2> Yes . I remember now . We put it off . I did make a mistake . But how shall we deal with the tickets ?
<speaker1> Since you have booked . Then let

<speaker1> Do you want some dessert ?
<speaker2> No , thank you . Check , please .
<speaker1> Wait a moment . I will calculate it for you . Your bill comes to $ 36 .
<speaker2> Here are $ 40 . Keep the change . That's my tip for you .

<speaker1> Food is less expensive in a cafeteria , because you serve yourself .
<speaker2> How to do it ?
<speaker1> Just pick up a tray , then put a knife , a fork , a spoon and a paper napkin on it and stand in the line .
<speaker2> How long will it take to reach the buffet ?
<speaker1> Not long , because people rush for lunch .
<speaker2> The line sure does move fast .
<speaker1> Tell the man behind the counter what you want .
<speaker2> OK . I like that green vegetable but I don't know how to call it .
<speaker1> Just point to it if you don't know the name .
<speaker2> All right .

<speaker1> Hey , did you hear about Jessica's party this weekend ?
<speaker2> Yeah , but I'm still waiting for my invitation .
<speaker1> Oh really ? She gave me mine earlier today .
<speaker2> Well , she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today .
<speaker1> Yeah , so are you planning on going ?
<speaker2> I think so . It sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun .
<speaker1> It really does , I can't wait .
<speaker2> What time does the party start ?
<speaker1> It starts at 8 o'clock .
<speaker2> Oh , well , how many people has she given invites to so far ?
<speaker1> I'm not sure , but I don't think she's given out that many .
<speaker2> Well , hopefully she'll give me my invite later on today .

<speaker1> After the financial crisis , many industries are in incredibly cloudy situations . How do you think about our company ?
<speaker2> The outlook in the future is very positive . Because we have been in this field for hundreds of years and we know how to survive this crisis safely .
<speaker1> As the department I am applying for is expanding , I would like to contribute by effort .
<speaker2> Great . Welcome to our company .

<speaker1> Farmer's Pet Store .
<speaker2> Can you please tell me where you are located ?
<speaker1> Sure , we are off Singing Road , close to the bank .
<speaker2> Thank you , I know where that is .

<speaker1> Hi , Bob , this is John Lin .
<speaker2> Hello , John .
<speaker1> I'm with Hartford public relations . I'd like to set up an appointment to come by and talk with you about our services .
<speaker2> How about tomorrow at 11 o'clock ?

<speaker1> Hey , Tom , did you enjoy your lunch ?
<speaker2> Oh , don't mention it . It was terrible .
<speaker1> What ' the matter ?
<speaker2> The food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone .
<speaker1> I see . You simply can't blame the server for this .
<speaker2> Yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district .
<speaker1> That's true .
<speaker2> Anyway , how was your such , Catherine ?
<speaker1> It was good . I brought lunch from home today .
<speaker2> You did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America .
<speaker1> Well , I personally don't like them because I don't believe that they are healthy .
<speaker2> I guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat .
<speaker1> Yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle , don't you ?
<speaker2> You bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America .
<speaker1> Well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places .
<speaker2> Seriously ?
<speaker1> Yeah , it's hard to believe but true .

<speaker1> Have you seen this news article ? Apparently an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote for them online .
<speaker2> Wow , that's really interesting . So who won ?
<speaker1> Well , the Great Wall of China , the Taj Mahal in India .
<speaker2> I've been there ! It really is an amazing work of architecture and art . The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb , the walls are covered with gems and emeralds !
<speaker1> Cool ! Also amongst the winners is Petra , in Jordan , Mach Pitch in Peru and the pyramid in Chichenitza in Mexico .
<speaker2> Wait a minute ! It also says that the Christ Re-deemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders . I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum , stand in the middle like a gladiator !
<speaker1> Well , let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year .
<speaker2> Good idea !

<speaker1> Hello , I'd like to reserve a hotel room .
<speaker2> That should be no problem . May I have your full name , please ?
<speaker1> My name is John Sandals .
<speaker2> Hello , Mr . Sandals . My name is Michelle . What days do you need that reservation , sir ?
<speaker1> I'm planning to visit New York from Friday , April 14 until Monday , April 17 .
<speaker2> Our room rates recently went up . Is that okay with you , Mr . Sandals ?
<speaker1> How much per night are we talking about ?
<speaker2> Each night will be $ 308 .
<speaker1> That price is perfectly acceptable .
<speaker2> Wonderful ! Do you prefer a smoking or nonsmoking room ?
<speaker1> Nonsmoking , please .
<speaker2> Next question , Is a queen-size bed okay ?
<speaker1> That sounds fine .
<speaker2> Okay , Mr . Sandals . Your reservation is in our computer . All we need now is a phone number .
<speaker1> Certainly . My phone number is 626-555-1739 .
<speaker2> Thank you , Mr . Sandals . We look forward to seeing you in New York !

<speaker2> No , make the second one with ham , pineapple and green peppers . Oh , and make it thin crust .
<speaker1> Okay , thin crust . Your total is $ 21.50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it

<speaker1> Hello , Personal Banking . How may I help you ?
<speaker2> Hi there . I'm calling about Personal Internet Banking , what details can you give me ?
<speaker1> Personal Internet Banking is a self service financial service that is based on the Internet . It can be used by both businesses and individuals . We offer an online payment service , Personal Net Banking , which includes services such as account transfers , personal foreign exchange trading . You can also get account management services , online bill payment , for household bills like gas and electricity ...
<speaker2> That sounds good . At the moment I spend ages queuing at the post office to pay my bills .

<speaker1> I was surprised to see how few people you have on-site . You provide a wide range of goods and services but have a very small workforce .
<speaker2> It depends on the time of year . At peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch . We also contract out certain services all year round , for example , cleaning . We run a very tight operation !
<speaker1> Do you handle the recruiting yourselves ?
<speaker2> Sometimes we use a local employment agency . It depends on the job .

<speaker1> Jeff , look at this listing ! It says there is a cozy studio apartment for rent , and it's only $ 700 per month . What do you think ?
<speaker2> Well I think I can afford that apartment . But are pets allowed ?
<speaker1> Hmm ... let me look . Yes , it says it's a pet-friendly building .
<speaker2> That's great . That means I can bring my cat , Mr . Twinkles . Where is the apartment located ?
<speaker1> It says it's located in the suburbs .

<speaker1> What would you like to have for dinner ? Chicken or beef ?
<speaker2> Chicken , please .
<speaker1> Good choice !
<speaker2> What kind of drinks do you have ?
<speaker1> Well , we have all kinds of beverages in addition to fruit juices .
<speaker2> In that case , let me have a glass of orange juice .
<speaker1> Anything else ?
<speaker2> I would like to have some tea as well .
<speaker1> Another flight attendant is coming down the aisle with coffee and tea .
<speaker2> I see .

<speaker1> I'd like to apply for a credit card . Can you help me with my application ?
<speaker2> I'd be glad to .
<speaker1> I'm afraid that I don't have a credit history . I just came to this country .
<speaker2> Do you have an account with this bank ?
<speaker1> I'm afraid not .
<speaker2> In that case I highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . That would help with your credit card application .
<speaker1> What is the interest rate on your card ?
<speaker2> The annual charge rate is 9.5 % .
<speaker1> That's very expensive !
<speaker2> Not really . The credit card is a revolving account . You only pay interest on what you owe .
<speaker1> How does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ?
<speaker2> You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized .
<speaker1> Does the card provide any other benefits ?
<speaker2> You can also get a cash advance up to 1,000 dollars on this card .

<speaker1> You're really fit , Paul . Do you exercise very much ?
<speaker2> Well , I almost always get up very early , and I lift weights for an hour .
<speaker1> You're kidding !
<speaker2> No . And then I often go Rollerblading .
<speaker1> Wow ! How often do you exercise like that ?
<speaker2> About five times a week . What about you ?
<speaker1> Oh , I hardly ever exercise . I usually just watch TV in my free time . I guess I'm a real couch potato !

<speaker1> I don't believe we've met .
<speaker2> No , I don't think we have .
<speaker1> My name is Gao Run .
<speaker2> How do you do ? My name is James Green .
<speaker1> Here's my name card .
<speaker2> And here's mine .
<speaker1> It's nice to finally meet you .
<speaker2> And I'm glad to meet you , too .

<speaker1> Marketing Manager
<speaker2> s fine . Please call again later .
<speaker1> OK . Thank you . Goodbye .

<speaker1> Can I help you ?
<speaker2> Yes , I need some traveler's checks .
<speaker1> How much do you need ?
<speaker2> Three thousand US dollars .
<speaker1> All right , can I have your passbook ?
<speaker2> Yes , here you go .
<speaker1> What amounts do you want the checks in ?
<speaker2> It's all the same to me .
<speaker1> Here you are .
<speaker2> Thanks .

<speaker1> The plumbing in my new apartment is not working .
<speaker2> I need you to tell me what the problem is .
<speaker1> The bathroom sink is stopped up .
<speaker2> Is the kitchen plumbing messed up also , or just the bathroom plumbing ?
<speaker1> Just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem .
<speaker2> Did this just start happening , or has it been going on for a while ?
<speaker1> Everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago .
<speaker2> Are you going to be home so I can come by and take a look at the problem ?
<speaker1> I am not sure if I will be home later .
<speaker2> I will be coming by around 10 this morning . If you aren
<speaker1> ll just use my key .

<speaker1> Grand Theft Auto Three is awesome !
<speaker2> It's more violent than TV news !
<speaker1> What time is it anyway ?
<speaker2> Nine-thirty .
<speaker1> Oh , my God , three hours already ! I have to get the chores done !
<speaker2> No time . That's their headlights in the window !
<speaker1> OK , emergency measures . Let's throw the dishes in the trash ! Two birds with one stone ...
<speaker2> Little dude , your life is over !
<speaker1> No time to worry . We have to dispose of this evidence .

<speaker1> How old is Keith ?
<speaker2> He's 21 . How old is James ?
<speaker1> He's a year older than Keith , but he looks younger .
<speaker2> How's your father ?
<speaker1> He's fine . He retired last week . It's a turning point in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .
<speaker2> He can spend more time with his grandchildren .
<speaker1> Oh , I don't think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
<speaker2> So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea !
<speaker1> How do you want to spend your old age ?
<speaker2> In the same way , probably .

<speaker1> Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ?
<speaker2> Sure , let me take a look ... Personal Information , Education , Experience , Training ... I think you should add another section for language . You speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume .
<speaker1> But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ?
<speaker2> Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities . It says something about your level of intellect and experience . Also , I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume .
<speaker1> It's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ?
<speaker2> Well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . That's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . But resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer .

<speaker1> Why not come over to work in my company ?
<speaker2> I need to think it over .
<speaker1> Tell me what you need .
<speaker2> All right . I'm prepared to , if the pay is reasonable .

<speaker1> We are approaching the top of the mountain .
<speaker2> What a beautiful view we have here .
<speaker1> Yes , you can have a bird's-eye view of the whole city .
<speaker2> Wonderful . Will we have any free time there ?
<speaker1> Of course . We will stay there for half an hour and you can do your own business .

<speaker1> what did you do last night ?
<speaker2> I just stayed at home and watched TV .
<speaker1> did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ?
<speaker2> yes , it was a very evenly matched game .
<speaker1> what were the results of the game ?
<speaker2> it ended in a tie .
<speaker1> what was the actual score ?
<speaker2> it was three all .
<speaker1> really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid .
<speaker2> if Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won .
<speaker1> what happened ?
<speaker2> their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway .
<speaker1> that explains it .
<speaker2> how many more games are left this season ?
<speaker1> that was the last game before the playoffs .
<speaker2> when do the playoffs start ?
<speaker1> in a few weeks . Are you planning on watching them ?
<speaker2> of course ! I really love watching football games on TV .
<speaker1> Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together .
<speaker2> sure , that would be great .
<speaker1> Ok , it's a date then !

<speaker1> how are you ?
<speaker2> I
<speaker1> s hard to keep track of everything around here .
<speaker2> That
<speaker1> re new , too , huh ?
<speaker2> Yeah . I just got here a couple of days ago . How about you ?

<speaker1> Excuse me . I bought this shirt yesterday , but I would like to refund it .
<speaker2> Gave me the receipt , please .
<speaker1> Here is my receipt .
<speaker2> What's wrong with it ?
<speaker1> It's too small for me to wear .
<speaker2> Would you like another bigger one ?
<speaker1> No thanks . I want to have a refund .
<speaker2> OK , here is your money .

<speaker1> Oh , so many kinds of winter hats .
<speaker2> What is your favorite color , miss ?
<speaker1> Red .
<speaker2> Here you are.It ' s very attractive .
<speaker1> May I try it on ?
<speaker2> Go ahead .
<speaker1> Is there a mirror around here ?
<speaker2> Right over there .
<speaker1> Does it suit me ?
<speaker2> Yes , you look very nice .
<speaker1> How much is it ?
<speaker2> We're having a clearance sale . $ 4 plus tax .
<speaker1> That's quite reasonable .

<speaker1> What can I help you with ?
<speaker2> May I ask you something ?
<speaker1> What's your question ?
<speaker2> How many hours behind the wheel do I need ?
<speaker1> What do you need to take it for ?
<speaker2> I'm trying to get my license .
<speaker1> You need six hours .
<speaker2> Can I do all six hours in one day ?
<speaker1> You have to do it in three days .
<speaker2> That's all I have to do ?
<speaker1> That's everything .
<speaker2> Well , that's a relief .

<speaker1> Excuse me , I have something to trouble you .
<speaker2> Yes ? I'll be very glad if I could be of any help to you .
<speaker1> An hour ago , I bought this vase with my tourist .
<speaker2> Oh , yes . I remember it clearly . Is there anything wrong with it ?
<speaker1> I'm afraid so . We found this crack on the bottom when I went back to my hotel .
<speaker2> Oh , how awful ! Let me have a look , I'm terribly sorry . It was most thoughtless of me . Would you excuse me , please ?
<speaker1> Oh , It's quite all right , I suppose . It can't be helped sometimes .
<speaker2> It's very kind of you to say so . How about changing another one for you ?
<speaker1> All right . Thank you .
<speaker2> Just a minute , please . I won't be long . I'm sure this one is perfect . You may examine it carefully .
<speaker1> Oh , yes , it is . I'll take this one .
<speaker2> I'm very sorry for any inconvenience I've caused you .
<speaker1> Well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing .

<speaker1> Here you are . You left the medicine here .
<speaker2> Sorry . I was too worried .
<speaker1> I firmly believe that you love your brother very much .
<speaker2> Absolutely . By the way , do you sell any traditional Chinese medicine ?
<speaker1> Yes , we have some Chinese medicine for common cold .
<speaker2> I heard Chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure .
<speaker1> It depends . It's true that you can take some for prevention .

<speaker1> What kind of place shall we rent ?
<speaker2> It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .
<speaker1> Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .
<speaker2> Neither am I . So a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area ?
<speaker1> I don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
<speaker2> Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
<speaker1> Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
<speaker2> How much do you think the rent will be ?
<speaker1> I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .

<speaker1> I have a terrible toothache .
<speaker2> Which tooth is it ?
<speaker1> This one here .
<speaker2> Ar , Yes . There
<speaker1> " I
<speaker2> ll have to be taken out . "
<speaker1> d better wait , the gums are swollen . Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days .

<speaker1> May I have a look at that vase , please ?
<speaker2> Of course . It's the best one I have here---and it's only 300 yuan .
<speaker1> Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive .
<speaker2> Really ? Even for such an excellent one ?

<speaker1> Can you tell me the best way to look for an apartment ?
<speaker2> The local newspaper has ads for housing .
<speaker1> Is there any way to find a roommate to share an apartment with ?
<speaker2> Sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate .
<speaker1> What do landlords charge for rent ?
<speaker2> Would you like an apartment for just yourself , or do you need it for two people ?
<speaker1> There are two of us , but we only need a one-bedroom apartment .
<speaker2> You should be able to easily find that for twelve hundred dollars a month .
<speaker1> I really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me .
<speaker2> Sure , I

<speaker1> Excuse me , would you please do me a favor ?
<speaker2> With pleasure .
<speaker1> I appreciate the building so much . I am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building .
<speaker2> No problem .

<speaker1> The product's selling points is its advanced technoledge .
<speaker2> Unfortunately , it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford .
<speaker1> Why is the price so high ?
<speaker2> It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly .
<speaker1> Model of computers aren't compatible ?
<speaker2> Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities .
<speaker1> Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable .
<speaker2> But by then , the technology will be outdated .
<speaker1> True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge .
<speaker2> That's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable .
<speaker1> This model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product .
<speaker2> I guess you get what you pay for .

<speaker1> What kind of permanent would you like to have ?
<speaker2> what kinds do you have ?
<speaker1> Oh , yeah , It

<speaker1> Hello ! How do I get more amenities ?
<speaker2> I'm sorry , sir . I'm not sure I understand .
<speaker1> I'm talking about the free stuff , like soap and shampoo .
<speaker2> Oh , I see . So , you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities .
<speaker1> No , no . I've got plenty left .
<speaker2> Now I'm confused again ! What is the problem ?
<speaker1> What am I going to do about souvenirs ?
<speaker2> Oh , I get it ! You want souvenirs !
<speaker1> Yes , I've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs .
<speaker2> Sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items , and as a guest you get a discount .
<speaker1> Please ! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs .
<speaker2> I understand completely , sir . Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment .

<speaker1> Excuse me . Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo ?
<speaker2> Well , you can take the No . 36 bus from here , but then you have to walk about 30 minutes .
<speaker1> That doesn't sound too bad .
<speaker2> Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo .
<speaker1> Maybe that's what I'll do . Thanks a lot .
<speaker2> You're welcome .

<speaker1> I'd like to order breakfast , please .
<speaker2> What'd you like , madam ?
<speaker1> Two muffins and a cup of coffee.Will it take long ?
<speaker2> No , just a few minutes .

<speaker1> How are you ?
<speaker2> I
<speaker1> s the problem ?
<speaker2> I wrote the check out for way too much .
<speaker1> How much ?
<speaker2> I wrote the check out for $ 150 .
<speaker1> What were you supposed to write it out for ?
<speaker2> I was supposed to write the check out for $ 100 .
<speaker1> I
<speaker2> s great . You

<speaker1> Would you like to take a look at the menu , sir ?
<speaker2> Yes . Thank you .
<speaker1> Would you care for a drink before you order ?
<speaker2> A glass of Qingdao beer .
<speaker1> Yes , sir . I'll bring it over . Have you decided what you'd like , sir ?
<speaker2> Will you make some recommendation ?

<speaker1> I
<speaker2> " Yes , Madam . The reporting desk for the British Airway
<speaker1> Thank you so much . Is this the desk for BA flight 123 to London ?
<speaker2> Yes , this is the right desk . Have you any luggage ?
<speaker1> The suitcase , that
<speaker2> t weigh your handbag .
<speaker1> Is there a receipt ?
<speaker2> Yes . I

<speaker1> It's time for bed .
<speaker2> But I'm not sleepy , Mum . Can I stay and watch more TV ?
<speaker1> It's already half past eleven . You have school tomorrow . You'll sleepy all tomorrow , if you don't sleep well tonight .
<speaker2> I know . But I promise I won't be sleepy tomorrow . I work really hard .
<speaker1> Don't you have the exams coming up soon ? I'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those .
<speaker2> Oh , I nearly forgot the exams .
<speaker1> You do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . Am I right ?
<speaker2> Yeah , I guess so . Maybe I can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow .
<speaker1> An excellent idea . Work now and play later .
<speaker2> I know you're right . School is more important than TV . Can I watch one more show , then go to bed .
<speaker1> No , now it's bedtime .

<speaker1> Yes , madam ? Can I help you ?
<speaker2> Oh , yes , please . But you are just closing , aren't you ?
<speaker1> Well , yes , we are , madam . The shop shuts down in five minutes .
<speaker2> I shall not keep you long then . It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week .
<speaker1> Last week , madam ? I really can't remember which ones you mean . What were they like ?
<speaker2> Oh , they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ?
<speaker1> That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ?
<speaker2> Oh , you must know the ones I mean . They were on sale , a real bargain . Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them .
<speaker1> I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans .
<speaker2> I don't think you did , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday .
<speaker1> Well , it's all new stock in the window now .
<speaker2> May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ?
<speaker1> Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing .
<speaker2> Yes , yes , I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ' d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot .
<speaker1> Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price .
<speaker2> Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color .
<speaker1> That might be the artificial lighting , madam . Of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it
<speaker2> " There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you . Thank goodness , they haven

<speaker1> I've come to hear about your offer .
<speaker2> We have the offer ready for you . Let me check . 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box , at 20,000 yuan ; 20 boxes with 50 waistbands per box , at 30,000 yuan ; 15 boxes with other ornaments per box , at 7 , 500 yuan , for shipment in June . The offer is valid for five days .
<speaker1> I can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected .
<speaker2> You know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where .
<speaker1> I am afraid I can't agree with you there . I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies .
<speaker2> But you must take the design and quality into consideration . You know we are superior to others in design and quality . We have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with .
<speaker1> I agree that yours are of the top .
<speaker2> Well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ?
<speaker1> To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help .
<speaker2> Impossible . How about 5 % off ?
<speaker1> Right . A reduction of 5 % is acceptable .

<speaker1> So I'm on the fifth floor ? How come this hotel has no fourth floor .
<speaker2> Four is an unlucky number here , Peter.Four sounds like death in Chinese.Hotels often have no fourth floor .
<speaker1> I see.Oh , I know what I wanted to ask.How much should I tip this guy ?
<speaker2> People don't usually tip here , but you can.Fifty dollars should be more enough .

<speaker1> Hello ! This is Ruby speaking from G . O . T . International Travel Agency . What can I do for you ?
<speaker2> I
<speaker1> d like to have a round trip ticket with a one-year open return .
<speaker2> Economy or Business Class ?
<speaker1> Economy , please . How much is it ?
<speaker2> It will be $ 850 .
<speaker1> Very good . Could I get an electronic ticket ? I
<speaker2> m tall and need to get up and walk pretty often .
<speaker1> No problem . Your ticket is for Trans Pacific Flight 87 from Detroit to Beijing at 3 forty p . m . on April 13 . You will arrive at Beijing International Airport at six 35 p . m . on April 14 . Your electronic
<speaker2> What time should I arrive at Detroit Airport ?
<speaker1> Please be at the airport two hours before your departure to check in . You also need to reconfirm your reservation with the airline at least 7 days prior to your departure .
<speaker2> What happens if I can
<speaker1> s OK . What are the weight restrictions for checked baggage ?
<speaker2> On Trans Pacific international flights , each ticketed passenger is permitted a maximum of two checked bags with a maximum weight per checked bag of 70 pounds .
<speaker1> That
<speaker2> m all set . You

<speaker1> I do want to meet with you and take a look at your catalogue . We
<speaker2> ll be glad to help you out . I can come out anytime on Tuesday or Thursday of next week .
<speaker1> Let
<speaker2> ll definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .
<speaker1> Fine . I

<speaker1> That looks graceful on you .
<speaker2> Thank you.But it is too bright for me .
<speaker1> How about this brown one ?
<speaker2> Let me try it on . I like that color .
<speaker1> Ok , i will get one for your.Here you are .
<speaker2> But it is too loose.Do you have the smaller size ?
<speaker1> Sorry , it had been sold out .
<speaker2> What a pity !

<speaker1> I

<speaker1> What

<speaker1> And there's a little upside-down Dilbert on the underside .
<speaker2> When you flip the tie up , he's right side up . Brilliant .
<speaker1> My dad will love this . He's a Dilbert fan .
<speaker2> I wouldn't mind having one myself ...
<speaker1> Model it for me .
<speaker2> OK !
<speaker1> Wow ! You look just as dorky as Dilbert !

<speaker1> Welcome . What can I do for you , Madam ?
<speaker2> I hope you can give me some advice . I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . It's such a long way from my home , but I checked and you are my nearest branch . Is there anyway I can do it from home ?
<speaker1> That's terrible . Unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service .
<speaker2> A Direct Debit Service ? What's that exactly ?
<speaker1> A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle .
<speaker2> But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills , not you .
<speaker1> We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies .
<speaker2> I see . So , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? That does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free .

<speaker1> Hello .
<speaker2> Hi . It
<speaker1> s office . Is Lily there ?
<speaker2> No , Lily is not here at the moment .
<speaker1> Could you ask her to call me back when she gets in ?
<speaker2> Sure . What
<speaker1> m Tony . Thank you very much .
<speaker2> You

<speaker1> So what do you think of my new dress ?
<speaker2> I think it's great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I've actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine's for a while now , but I wasn't sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment .
<speaker1> Um , ninety-five dollars ?
<speaker2> Yes , that's the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ?
<speaker1> I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen's Boutique . I didn't know I could get it cheaper somewhere else .
<speaker2> Of course ! Everything at Helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn't you shop around ?
<speaker1> I don't know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive .

<speaker1> Who gave my dog this cooked chicken bone ?
<speaker2> I did . Why ?
<speaker1> Didn't you know dogs shouldn't eat cooked chicken bones because they're bad for their stomachs ?
<speaker2> No , I didn't . I'm sorry . It won't happen again .

<speaker1> Is it Fred's fault ?
<speaker2> No , I don't suppose he's to blame.The man in the other car made a mistake .
<speaker1> But he's equally responsible because he tried to overtake you .

<speaker1> In foreign trade , exporters have to adjust their product in a timely manner .
<speaker2> How to adjust ?
<speaker1> Exporters must ensure that their product satisfies customers ' needs , wants and likes .
<speaker2> Ah , some products are successful at home , but not be popular overseas .
<speaker1> That's because the fashion , taste and social customs and so on vary considerably .
<speaker2> Yes , sometimes the differences are great .
<speaker1> Well , we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product .
<speaker2> We have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales .

<speaker1> I hate doing the damn laundry .
<speaker2> Watch your language .

<speaker1> I want to buy three tickets . What's the entrance fee ?
<speaker2> $ 10 per person .
<speaker1> Here are $ 30 . By the way , where can I find a guide ?
<speaker2> Turn to the next window and they will help you find one .
<speaker1> Thanks a lot .

<speaker1> Shall we share a taxi ?
<speaker2> Where are you heading now ?
<speaker1> I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road.It is very close to your house .
<speaker2> Is that the university next to the Teachers ' College ?
<speaker1> That's the one .
<speaker2> You mean we'll share the taxi ?
<speaker1> Yeah.If we share the cab , it'll be cheaper.Besides that your Chinese is better than mine.The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully .
<speaker2> Well.Don ' t worry about it , I will be happy to share the taxi with you .

<speaker1> Good morning.Are you Mr.Liu ?
<speaker2> My name is Liu Lichi . How do you do ?
<speaker1> How do you do ? Please be seated , How is your trip here ?
<speaker2> Quite good , I think . I came here by bus , and it took me about 15 minutes .
<speaker1> Oh , yes.How old are you ?
<speaker2> Twenty .
<speaker1> Hum , still a student ?
<speaker2> Yes , I'm student of grade 3 in the university majoring in economics .
<speaker1> What subjects are you studying ?
<speaker2> English , math , commercial and legal studies , and accountancy .
<speaker1> Have you had any working experience .
<speaker2> Well , I worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays .
<speaker1> What do you like to do in your spare time ?
<speaker2> I like sports very much.Besides that , I also like working on a computer in my spare time .
<speaker1> How are your English and computer skills ?
<speaker2> I have passed the CET - 4 and 6.As far as computer is concerned I can use the computer for word processing .
<speaker1> Okay . Mr.Liu , we'll inform you of the results within a week .

<speaker1> That dress is very pretty . Why don
<speaker2> s too loud .
<speaker1> We
<speaker2> t suit me .
<speaker1> What style do you want ?
<speaker2> I want to buy a V-neck checked sweater , and it should be tight .
<speaker1> Oh , I see.How about the color ?
<speaker2> Quiet color .
<speaker1> I know a shop selling this kind of sweaters .
<speaker2> Really ? Let

<speaker1> Hey Julie , you want to go grab something to eat ?
<speaker2> Sure ! What do you feel like having ?
<speaker1> I really feel like having a big juicy steak !
<speaker2> Oh . OK . I don't eat meat , but that's fine , I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ?
<speaker1> I didn't know you were a vegetarian !
<speaker2> I'm not , I am a vegan .
<speaker1> A what ?
<speaker2> A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood .
<speaker1> Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough !
<speaker2> It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult .

<speaker1> How do you feel about that restaurant ?
<speaker2> It wasn't all that great .
<speaker1> What did you dislike the most ?
<speaker2> I don't think that they had their act together . They didn't seem well prepared .
<speaker1> Did you think that the food was any good ?
<speaker2> I wasn't all that impressed by the food .
<speaker1> The service certainly could have been better .
<speaker2> The service did not help the situation .
<speaker1> Is this a restaurant that you want to come back to ?
<speaker2> I am not interested in trying this restaurant again .

<speaker1> Let me see your passport . Is London your final destination ?
<speaker2> No . I am a transit passenger going to Sweden .
<speaker1> How long are you going to stay here ?
<speaker2> Only one night .
<speaker1> Do you have any dutiable items ?
<speaker2> No , I don't .
<speaker1> What are these ?
<speaker2> They are my personal effects .

<speaker1> I heard that you finished my home inspection , and I was wondering how it went .
<speaker2> First of all , we need to understand what I was looking for . Do you know what the purpose of an inspection is ?
<speaker1> I am not sure what a home inspection is all about .
<speaker2> I went there to check for problems with the home , so you aren
<speaker1> t the owners have told me about any problems ?
<speaker2> Sellers aren
<speaker1> t aware of .
<speaker2> Can I require the owners to fix the problems ?
<speaker1> You can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems .
<speaker2> What did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ?
<speaker1> There were no major problems . One leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that I found .

<speaker1> How you celebrate your Valentine

<speaker1> Yesterday I had a quarrel with my roommate . I'm really fed up with all this .
<speaker2> Tell me what seems to be the problem .
<speaker1> My roommate always brings a lot of friends from off-campus . They stay in the room until midnight , singing and talking , drinking and playing cards while I have no place for study . I even don't have the quietness to sleep .
<speaker2> Did you ever talk to him about it ?

<speaker1> What can I do for you today ?
<speaker2> I have a question .
<speaker1> What do you need to know ?
<speaker2> I need to take the driver's course . How many hours do I need ?
<speaker1> It depends on what you're trying to do with the completion of the course .
<speaker2> I need to get my license .
<speaker1> You're going to need to complete six hours .
<speaker2> How many hours a day can I do ?
<speaker1> You can do two hours a day for three days .
<speaker2> That's all I need to do to finish ?
<speaker1> Yes , that's all you need to do .
<speaker2> Thanks . I'll get back to you .

<speaker2> Yes , please .
<speaker1> OK . I'll get the bellman to taka them up . Which bags are yours ?
<speaker2> My luggage is in the corner over there . They are the leather suitcase , the canvass holdall and the blue backpack .
<speaker1> OK .
<speaker2> Please be careful with the suitcase , it's very heavy .
<speaker1> I'll let the bellboy know . Don't worry , he's very strong .
<speaker2> And the holdall has some fragile items inside , so please be careful with that too .
<speaker1> Of course .

<speaker1> How far do we have to go ?
<speaker2> About 50 miles .
<speaker1> The traffic is not very heavy on this high way , is it ? So I
<speaker2> ll make it .

<speaker1> Sorry , but I've gotta run . Enjoy your food , and ring the service button if you need anything else !

<speaker1> How can we develop a new brand image with no direction whatsoever ?
<speaker2> With the fifty forwards he sent out today , maybe we'll inadvertently get inspired .
<speaker1> I guess this is a good excuse to surf the Net on someone else's dime .
<speaker2> Who'd have thought Bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic ?
<speaker1> He must have just got online for the first time last week . He still thinks it's some kind of new toy .

<speaker1> Okay , so we're agreed on 900 .
<speaker2> I'm happy with that price .
<speaker1> Let's shake on it .
<speaker2> Okay , let's shake on it .

<speaker1> May I help you ?
<speaker2> Give me a Big Mac , a small order of French fries and a medium Coke .
<speaker1> You'll need to wait a few minutes for the fries . They are still in the fryer .
<speaker2> That's fine .
<speaker1> Your total comes to $ 7 .
<speaker2> Here's a twenty . Could you give me some more napkins ?
<speaker1> Sure . Your cash back is $ 13 . And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes .
<speaker2> Thanks .

<speaker1> Let me tell you some more . The interest is settled on the 20th of the last month in each quarter , It's paid quarterly . Of course it also needs to be settled if you cancel the account .
<speaker2> Miao Ping , in your opinion , should we go for the Type A or Type B Account ?
<speaker1> Well , the Type B Account is very restricted . If your aim is to use the account the same way as your use your Settlement Account , I would recommend the Type A Account for you .
<speaker2> Thanks for your time . I'll go and discuss everything with my partner and I'll be back later .

<speaker1> Sarah , you don't look so good . What's the matter ?
<speaker2> I've got a really bad headache and my stomach hurts .

<speaker2> I'll see what I have . What do you need it for ?
<speaker1> I want to get cigarettes .
<speaker2> You can use quarters , dimes and nickels .

<speaker1> Barely . Will you be checking any luggage today ?
<speaker2> Yes , One suitcase . I also have a carry-on bag .
<speaker1> Ok . Mr . Lee , you

<speaker1> Which university did you graduate from ?
<speaker2> I graduated from Peking University .
<speaker1> What was your major at university ?
<speaker2> I studied economics , I am especially interested in the economic development of China .
<speaker1> What course did you like best ?
<speaker2> I like Business Management , and i think it's very useful for the present work .
<speaker1> What do you think is the relationship between the subjects you've taken and the job you are seeking ?
<speaker2> I've taken courses on office administration , reports and correspondence writing . I think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager , because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .

<speaker1> Marco has fallen off a ladder . I think he's hurt his back . What shall we do ?
<speaker2> We'd better not move him . I'll get the first-aider .

<speaker1> Have you ever shopped online ?
<speaker2> Quite often . It is very convenient , saving me a lot of time .
<speaker1> Do you have some experiences to share with me ? I want to have a try .
<speaker2> You are asking the right person . Here are two very important tips . First , you need to visit no more than one site to find the best products and prices . I can recommend you some online merchants . Second , write your mail address correctly . Otherwise , you can

<speaker1> Hey , you look great ! how's everything ?
<speaker2> Yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit .
<speaker1> Really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work .
<speaker2> It's important to do proper exercises .
<speaker1> You're right . Too much or too little won't do any good .
<speaker2> The trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet .
<speaker1> Sounds reasonable .
<speaker2> We should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
<speaker1> And fruits !
<speaker2> Surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .
<speaker1> I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
<speaker2> Yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can also help one to keep sound physical health .
<speaker1> I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .
<speaker2> You bet it !

<speaker1> What's your main range ?
<speaker2> Generally speaking , we provide bikes for both gentlemen and ladies , size 19 , 21 , 23 , 25 and 27 inches . We can vary the colors according to the buyer's requirements . Here are the catalogues and the pattern books . They will give you a rough idea about our products .
<speaker1> I am interested in your flying pigeon bicycles . I think some of these items will find a ready market in Canada . But what our customers appreciate most is a reliable product .
<speaker2> To be reliable is the strong point of our products . As a matter of fact , it's always our practice to supply high quality goods at reasonable prices . Flying pigeon is the best of its kind at the price .
<speaker1> Then I'd like to know your availability of the products and the terms of sales , such as mode of payment , delivery , discounts , etc .

<speaker1> I have learnt how to ride a bicycle . I plan to go to the Water Park by bike this weekend .
<speaker2> Well , you know , the traffic in Beijing is sometimes dangerous . Therefore , I have to remind you of something . First , you should obey the traffic rules , don't break in the red light . Second , don't play a joke with your friends when riding on the bike . Third , do not hurry up when riding , or would make an accident . Finally , remember come on the left and go on the right !
<speaker1> Oh , my dear sister , I am no longer a baby !

<speaker1> You have a lovely house , Jack .
<speaker2> Thank you . But a number of things have been going wrong lately .
<speaker1> That's too bad . What problems are you having .
<speaker2> Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over .
<speaker1> I've studied home decoration as a hobby . Could I make some suggestions ?
<speaker2> Go right ahead .
<speaker1> Well , I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . Also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room
<speaker2> Wow , you really do have a talent for this , Alice . Thanks for the suggestions .
<speaker1> You are welcome , Jack . Glad to be of help .

<speaker2> Don't worry . You'll be fine . First of all , put on your seat belt . Adjust the mirrors .
<speaker1> You don't think I'll need the seat belt , do you ?
<speaker2> Of course not . But it's a good habit to put it on every time you drive .
<speaker1> Just in case , right ?
<speaker2> Right . Hold the steering wheel with your hands at ten o'clock and two o'clock .

<speaker1> Yeah , she's hot . Radiator's leaking . Looks like you were running her pretty hard .
<speaker2> That must have been just before I got the speeding ticket .
<speaker1> Did you have an accident recently ... Hey , wait a second ! I know this car !
<speaker2> You do ?
<speaker1> I ran into it a couple of weeks ago . What do you know ? Name's Hal .
<speaker2> I'm Akimbo . Nice to meet you , I guess .
<speaker1> Boy , I'm sure sorry about your car . Hey , Akimbo , I wonder if you'd like to make a deal ?
<speaker2> What kind of deal ?
<speaker1> I'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car .
<speaker2> You don't want your insurance company to pay for it ?
<speaker1> I'd rather not . They'll raise my rates . It'll cost me more in the long run .
<speaker2> If you give me cash , do you care if I don't fix the car ?
<speaker1> Hell , I don't care . Just don'T submit a report to your insurancecompany .
<speaker2> It's a deal , Hal . Thanks again for stopping to help . And thanks for smashing my car !

<speaker2> I'm ready now . I'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn .
<speaker1> And would you like an appetizer before your meal ? The soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup .

<speaker2> OK .
<speaker1> I'll get the flour out .
<speaker2> Let me help you .

<speaker1> We have made some adjustment on the prices . And this is renewed price list .
<speaker2> Thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side .
<speaker1> This is our rock-bottom price , and we can't make any further reduction .
<speaker2> If so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks .
<speaker1> Then what

<speaker1> What do you usually have for breakfast ? Pancakes or waffles ?
<speaker2> I usually have cereal for breakfast .
<speaker1> But isn't it served with cold milk ?
<speaker2> Yeah . Cold milk wakes me up .
<speaker1> Chinese people don't like to eat cold food .
<speaker2> Is that right ?
<speaker1> But I'm open to new things . I'll have a bowl of cereal , too .
<speaker2> With cold milk ?
<speaker1> With cold milk !

<speaker1> I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season .
<speaker2> That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
<speaker1> It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
<speaker2> That is the best one I have seen . I am sure our target customers , young people will love it .
<speaker1> Certainly .

<speaker1> Hi , I need to copy something right now .
<speaker2> Our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine , sir .
<speaker1> Great ! How much per copy ?
<speaker2> Sir , one copy is ten cents .
<speaker1> Okay , I'll be down there shortly .
<speaker2> You probably won't have to wait for anyone , sir .

<speaker1> Hi , Ellen . That outfit looks terrific !
<speaker2> Thanks , Jim . I didn
<speaker1> t usually admit it !
<speaker2> Well , thanks for the compliment anyway !

<speaker1> This Olympic park is so big !
<speaker2> Yes . Now we are in the Olympic stadium , the center of this park .
<speaker1> Splendid ! When is it gonna be finished ?
<speaker2> The whole stadium is to be finished this June .
<speaker1> How many seats are there in the stand ?
<speaker2> Oh , there are 5000 seats in total .
<speaker1> I didn

<speaker1> It's located in the suburbs ? Well even though that sounds like a steal , I really want something downtown .
<speaker2> OK . Well the problem is that the apartments in the heart of the city are usually more expensive .
<speaker1> I know , that's my problem . What do you think I should do ?
<speaker2> Well , maybe you could get a two-bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate .
<speaker1> Oh , great idea !

<speaker1> So , Monica , how do you like your new office ?
<speaker2> Well , I love it . The room is spacious and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place !
<speaker1> That
<speaker2> t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
<speaker1> Totally agree . By the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .

<speaker1> Now , if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English ?
<speaker2> Yes , that
<speaker1> m pleased to see that you also got a distinction .
<speaker2> Yes that
<speaker1> Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I
<speaker2> Ve always been keen on writing , so I became the editor for the University student magazine , which I really loved . Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter , to help the homeless in York .
<speaker1> What did that involve ?
<speaker2> Providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
<speaker1> I
<speaker2> s move on to your work experience , shall we ?
<speaker1> Yes , okay .

<speaker1> Could you change these for me , please ?
<speaker2> What would you like ?
<speaker1> Twenties and some smaller bills , please .
<speaker2> Anything else ?
<speaker1> Yes . Could you tell many balance ? Here's account number .

<speaker1> Now , what seems to be the trouble ?
<speaker2> It's nothing serious . But I always have a headache , and I haven't slept properly for several weeks . I've also lost appetite and my eyes are burning .
<speaker1> Mm , you do look rather pale . Let me take your temperature . Would you put the thermometer under your arm , please ? Now , let me listen to your pulse . Mm , do you feel weak ?
<speaker2> Yes , I never seem to have any energy .
<speaker1> I'll give you a blood test . Would you roll up your sleeve ? Just as I thought . You're anemic . You'd better pay more attention to your diet . Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . And don't stay up late working . Try to get more rest .
<speaker2> Thank you .

<speaker1> Excuse me , I would like to know something about this campus . Right now it seems very big and confusing ! I have no idea where I am going or what I am doing .
<speaker2> Do you have a map of the campus ?
<speaker1> Yes , I have , but it doesn
<speaker2> m not very good at reading maps .
<speaker1> Do you know where your classes are ?
<speaker2> More or less . I go to three different buildings , and always get there late . I feel so hopeless . I don
<speaker1> " That
<speaker2> t know the short cuts . You

<speaker1> Good morning , I would like to reserve a berth .
<speaker2> Which train do you like ?
<speaker1> T112 to Washington please .
<speaker2> May I have your name ?
<speaker1> That's Lincoln .

<speaker1> Will you be voting ?
<speaker2> I can
<speaker1> m voting for is the best .
<speaker2> What do you like about him ?
<speaker1> He is very intelligent .
<speaker2> You think so ?
<speaker1> That
<speaker2> m glad to hear that you are so excited .
<speaker1> I
<speaker2> m sure he will be .
<speaker1> I

<speaker1> Good morning . May I help you ?
<speaker2> Yes , I'd like to check out now . My name's Adams , room 312 . Here's the key .
<speaker1> One moment , please , sir . ... Here's your bill . Would you like to check and see if the amount is correct ?
<speaker2> What's the 14 pounds for ?
<speaker1> That's for the phone calls you made from your room .
<speaker2> Can I pay with traveller's cheques ?
<speaker1> Certainly . May I have your passport , please ?
<speaker2> Here you are .
<speaker1> Could you sign each cheque here for me ?
<speaker2> Sure .
<speaker1> Here are your receipt and your change , sir . Thank you .
<speaker2> Thank you . Goodbye .

<speaker1> What type of people do you work with most effectively ?
<speaker2> I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.It ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because I move quickly and I am decisive .
<speaker1> What things impress you in your colleagues ?
<speaker2> I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment .
<speaker1> What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ?
<speaker2> The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior .
<speaker1> How do you organize and plan for major projects ?
<speaker2> I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.Then , I set a timetable that's realistic.What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react .
<speaker1> Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure .
<speaker2> I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks.The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me.Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed .
<speaker1> How do you manage your time in a typical day ?
<speaker2> I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value.The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week .
<speaker1> Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion .
<speaker2> I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings .

<speaker1> Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the Dalai Lama ?
<speaker2> Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth !
<speaker1> I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better .
<speaker2> Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards .
<speaker1> It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case .

<speaker1> I am sorry to have kept all of you waiting . I was delayed by something urgent .
<speaker2> You are not late , Mr . Thomas . There're still 15 minutes to go . Mr . White has just called you .
<speaker1> What did he say ?
<speaker2> He said there was a traffic jam , but he is coming .
<speaker1> He shouldn't drive his car . He should come here by bus .

<speaker1> Want to send out for some Chinese ?
<speaker2> Some what ?
<speaker1> Some Chinese food . I'm hungry , and there's a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat .
<speaker2> No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ?
<speaker1> Okay . I could go for that . It's called Al's Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like .
<speaker2> Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ?
<speaker1> Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered .
<speaker2> What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste .
<speaker1> Don't worry . We'll just get a doggie bag .

<speaker1> Do you get the news that our company is trying to find out new tactics to test us ?
<speaker2> I know something about it . Our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills .
<speaker1> It takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures , so I can not bear it anymore . It is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills .
<speaker2> Is that true ?
<speaker1> Definitely !
<speaker2> If that information is exact , I guess our company is willing to promote someone .

<speaker1> Hello sir , how may I help you ?
<speaker2> I would like to buy some flowers , please . Something really nice .
<speaker1> I see , may I ask what the occasion is ?
<speaker2> It
<speaker1> s more like I
<speaker2> m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ?
<speaker1> Mmm , well this is our I
<speaker2> t think that
<speaker1> m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ?
<speaker2> Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier .
<speaker1> Get out of my store , you jerk !

<speaker1> I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights ?
<speaker2> I'm very sorry , sir . I could put you on a waiting list , but you would be wise to check out other means of travel .
<speaker1> You mean like a bus ? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ?
<speaker2> I have not sir . But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here .
<speaker1> Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well .
<speaker2> Here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list .
<speaker1> How many people are on the waiting list right now ?
<speaker2> Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list . And you are number 176 .

<speaker1> How do you think they could be ended ?
<speaker2> I don't think that there is any easy way . The United Nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate .
<speaker1> So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer.If the problem is resources , share them .
<speaker2> It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it's harder to make peace between countries .
<speaker1> Yes , it is.One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive .

<speaker1> You still have not given me those files I
<speaker2> m sorry , Mr . Myers . I
<speaker1> t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We
<speaker2> re going to have to keep up .
<speaker1> You
<speaker2> ll get those files for you now .

<speaker1> What sort of job would you like to take ?
<speaker2> I prefer a sedentary job and I used to work as an operator .
<speaker1> We need an operator now .
<speaker2> It's just the job I've been searching for .

<speaker1> I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past .
<speaker2> I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process .
<speaker1> And it takes up all the news .
<speaker2> The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up .
<speaker1> It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public .
<speaker2> Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio .
<speaker1> I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio .
<speaker2> Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line .

<speaker1> Hello , Miss Wu , This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited . I'd like to check my last order . When exactly was it sent out ?
<speaker2> I can check that for you right now . Would you mind holding ?
<speaker1> Sure . No problem .
<speaker2> Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ?
<speaker1> Sure . Do you have my number ?
<speaker2> Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this .
<speaker1> No problem . I'll wait for your call .

<speaker1> What are you typing there ?
<speaker2> I'm working on my resume .
<speaker1> Really ? Did you find any information about a new job ?
<speaker2> Yeah , I just got some good information off the internet .
<speaker1> Great ! Do you think you have a chance at getting the job ?
<speaker2> I didn
<speaker1> s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls .
<speaker2> But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . You might have no chance .
<speaker1> How do you know if you don

<speaker1> Would you please show me the necklace in the window ?
<speaker2> Is this the one you want ?
<speaker1> No , the one next to it .
<speaker2> Here you are .
<speaker1> Thanks . What kind of stone is this ?
<speaker2> It's a ruby . It is from South Africa . Would you like to try it on ?
<speaker1> Yes , please . How much is it ?
<speaker2> It costs $ 200 .
<speaker1> It looks good . OK . I'll take it .

<speaker1> Happy birthday , Jim !
<speaker2> Thank you , Lisa .
<speaker1> Here is a present for you . I hope you like it .
<speaker2> Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time .
<speaker1> I'm very glad to hear that .
<speaker2> Come here , let me introduce some friends to you .

<speaker1> What's wrong with you ? You look pale .
<speaker2> I'm not sure , I feel hot and cold .
<speaker1> When did the trouble start ?
<speaker2> I was sick most of the night .
<speaker1> It sounds like you are coming down with the flu . Let me take your temperature .
<speaker2> Have I got a high fever ?
<speaker1> Yes , thirty-eight point seven . Do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ?
<speaker2> Yes , I have .
<speaker1> Now , let me have a look at you . I'd like to listen to your chest . Now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it Cough , now again . I want to examine your throat , too . Open wide , say ' Ah - - '
<speaker2> Aaaaahh , aaaaahh .
<speaker1> Yes , it does look a bit sore . Let's take an X-ray of your chest and give you a few tests .
<speaker2> All right , thanks .
<speaker1> The tests showed nothing wrong . A slight viral infection .
<speaker2> What shall I do today ?
<speaker1> I'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . Take an aspirin when you've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . Drink plenty of water , then you'll feel better . Here's the prescription .

<speaker1> I have to check out today . I'd like my bill ready by 10 this morning .
<speaker2> You can be sure of that , sir .
<speaker1> Thank you .

<speaker1> I called HP about my computer .
<speaker2> What did they say ?
<speaker1> They said I need a new hard drive .
<speaker2> That's too bad . How much is a new one ?
<speaker1> It's not too much , only about $ 85 .
<speaker2> Plus installation ?
<speaker1> No , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace .
<speaker2> Really ?
<speaker1> Yes , it's just a couple of screws .
<speaker2> That's nice .
<speaker1> It's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 .
<speaker2> If my hard drive crashes , I'll just call you .

<speaker1> Gosh , it's 7:30 , I'll miss the first class .
<speaker2> Don't get up so late next time . You should have gone to bed earlier last night .
<speaker1> Yes , Mum .

<speaker1> Is there anything wrong ?
<speaker2> I
<speaker1> t decide about college .
<speaker2> Don
<speaker1> s just a part of being a teenager .
<speaker2> I don
<speaker1> t affect her decision .
<speaker2> But I just want to give her some tips .
<speaker1> Oh , she can make her own decisions .
<speaker2> I guess you are right .
<speaker1> Believe me . Everything will be ok .
<speaker2> I hope so .

<speaker1> It's beautiful here .
<speaker2> Yes . I feel refreshed .
<speaker1> How long will we dock ?
<speaker2> In half an hour . The surface of the lake is calm .
<speaker1> Yes . We come at the right time .

<speaker1> that was a really good meal , Gordon .
<speaker2> It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite .
<speaker1> well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home .
<speaker2> you're right . I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow .
<speaker1> let's see how much the bill is .
<speaker2> don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat .
<speaker1> what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill .
<speaker2> no , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't .
<speaker1> no way , Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill .
<speaker2> alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill .
<speaker1> that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk .
<speaker2> just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week , ok ?
<speaker1> you've got a deal .
<speaker2> great . Bye .
<speaker1> bye .

<speaker1> I hear you are planning to travel abroad .
<speaker2> Yes . I'm going to the Untied States for travel . What places do you recommend ?
<speaker1> In my opinion , there are several places you mustn't miss , like Washington D . C , Las Vegas , New York and Los Angeles .
<speaker2> Someone suggests that I should go to Seattle and Hawaii .
<speaker1> Yes , you may consider those two places also . Seattle , for example , is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called Museum of Flight .
<speaker2> And Seattle is the home of Microsoft and Boeing . That must be a great place . I can't miss it .

<speaker1> This looks like a very nice house .
<speaker2> You know , I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on it .
<speaker1> The style of the exterior is just what I
<speaker2> s go look at that next .
<speaker1> There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room .
<speaker2> I know that you like this house , but let

<speaker1> Room service.What can I do for you ?
<speaker2> l am afraid there isn't any fancy soap in my room .
<speaker1> Sorry sir , we will bring you one.Anything else ?
<speaker2> Yes.Bring me a bath towel as well .

<speaker1> Good afternoon.British Airline.Is there any thing I can do for you ?
<speaker2> Can I make a reservation for flight FW58 to San Marino ?
<speaker1> Sure . When do you want to take the plane ?
<speaker2> Next Monday .
<speaker1> Will that be first class or economy seat ?
<speaker2> What's the fare for a first class seat ?
<speaker1> $ 200 .
<speaker2> Oh . I am not a wall streeter.Give me an economy one please .

<speaker1> Hello , Sir . So , you are back ?
<speaker2> Yes , hello again . I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit .
<speaker1> That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate .
<speaker2> And I can purchase that here ?
<speaker1> Yes . And if you already have a Current Account with us , the Insurance Premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle .

<speaker1> Are there any beds vacant ?
<speaker2> Yes , what kind of room do you want ?
<speaker1> I prefer one facing the sea . Besides , it should have a shower .
<speaker2> Sorry , right now we can only have you a room without shower .
<speaker1> Well , that's fine .

<speaker1> Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company .
<speaker2> That's easy . It was your office ergonomics that decided me .
<speaker1> You're kidding ! Something as simple as that ?
<speaker2> Yes . It is very important to me . My mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and I know that t
<speaker1> Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ?
<speaker2> Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff .
<speaker1> Well , welcome to the team .

<speaker1> Good afternoon . I've brought the extra blanket you asked for .
<speaker2> Oh , thank you .
<speaker1> Is there anything I can do for you now ?
<speaker2> Yes . I'm rather tired and want to go to bed early . Please make the bed .
<speaker1> Certainly , sir .

<speaker1> Lin's office supplies . How may I direct your call ?
<speaker2> Marry Lin please .
<speaker1> Sure , just a moment . ... I'm sorry no one answer the phone .
<speaker2> All right , could I leave a message ?
<speaker1> Certainly !
<speaker2> Please ask her to call John .

<speaker1> Excuse me . Where is the way out ?
<speaker2> Well , that's what I'm looking for myself .
<speaker1> It's very confusing in here , isn't it ?
<speaker2> Absolutely . Oh , do you see a sign there ?
<speaker1> It should be the way out .
<speaker2> OK . Let's go and see .

<speaker1> Excuse me , I ordered the well-done steak , but this one is so tough .
<speaker2> Well , sir , I think I have made a mistake . I will take it back to the kitchen right now .
<speaker1> I think you should be more careful next time .
<speaker2> Yes , sir . I'm really so sorry about that .

<speaker1> Allan , I am really disappointed by your lack of effort on this project .
<speaker2> Look , Sally . I
<speaker1> m sorry . I disagree . I don
<speaker2> Ve been working at full speed at all .
<speaker1> Well . I

<speaker1> Hi Joe , how are you doing today ?
<speaker2> Things are going good today . How have you been doing , Mary ?
<speaker1> Things are going well for me , Joe .
<speaker2> Want to go see a movie tonight ?
<speaker1> My parents are taking me to dinner tonight .
<speaker2> Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night , instead ?
<speaker1> What movie did you want to see ?
<speaker2> There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer .
<speaker1> I was thinking that I would like to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ”
<speaker2> Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to !

<speaker1> How's the bride-to-be ?
<speaker2> Tired and stressed . This wedding is giving me a headache .
<speaker1> Just relax . With me as your maid of honor , everything will be fine !
<speaker2> I'm worried that everything will be chaotic !
<speaker1> Hey ! I'm the tour guide . I'll take care of the Taiwanese guests .
<speaker2> You're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means ...
<speaker1> I will . Don't worry !

<speaker1> Jim ? Jim ? ... What are you doing in the kitchen ?
<speaker2> Nothing , Mummy . I was hungry so I came here for some milk .
<speaker1> Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk .
<speaker2> I don't , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator .
<speaker1> Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ?
<speaker2> Nothing .
<speaker1> What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see .
<speaker2> Promise that you won't get angry .
<speaker1> OK , I promise . What is it ?
<speaker2> It's a kitty .
<speaker1> Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house .
<speaker2> Please , Mummy . Everybody else in my class keeps a pet . Please , I'll take care of it . It's a good kitty . It'll not bring you any trouble .
<speaker1> No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here .
<speaker2> Please , Mummy . I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . It was starving and looking for something to eat . Please ! You see , it's so cute and tame .
<speaker1> All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up .
<speaker2> I will . Thank you , Mummy .

<speaker1> I was wondering if you could help me with something .
<speaker2> Sure , anything you say .
<speaker1> Actually , it
<speaker2> t worry about it , just ask .
<speaker1> What words do I need to know to buy a pair of shoes ?
<speaker2> You need to know the type of shoes you want .
<speaker1> Don
<speaker2> m going shopping this afternoon .

<speaker1> Excuse me . How long has it been since the business was founded ?
<speaker2> It has been 12 years since it was founded in 1998 .
<speaker1> So , it has a history for more than a decade ?
<speaker2> Yes . And it was incorporated with other businesses in 2008 due to the global financial crisis .

<speaker1> What can I do for you , Madam ?
<speaker2> Can you help me with Comprehensive Credit Granting ?
<speaker1> Certainly , Madam . What would you like to know ?
<speaker2> Well , everything really .
<speaker1> All right . We can grant a Financing Promise Quota , if you qualify . This means that we can deal with all of your needs in a speedy and efficient way . Firstly , your Credit Rating must be class A , and your Debt to Asset Ratio must be top notch , for the industry you are involved in .

<speaker1> Let's do something outdoors today .
<speaker2> All right . But I don't want to play tennis . We played tennis last weekend .
<speaker1> Okay . what do you want to do ?
<speaker2> I want to go jogging .
<speaker1> All right . That sounds like fun .

<speaker1> Good afternoon . I come here specially to pick up my tickets . I booked it last month.This is my reservation note .
<speaker2> I am terribly sorry . You didn't come to reconfirm recently.You should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it's an international flight , any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled .
<speaker1> But I have been so busy all these days.Well , is there any other ticket available ? I want the next one .

<speaker1> The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest .
<speaker2> Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West .
<speaker1> No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested .
<speaker2> You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ?
<speaker1> Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other .
<speaker2> Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ?
<speaker1> Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely .
<speaker2> Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ?
<speaker1> Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate .

<speaker1> Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ?
<speaker2> We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock .
<speaker1> You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order .
<speaker2> OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ?
<speaker1> I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time .
<speaker2> OK , will do .

<speaker1> I want a pair of sports shoes , Adidas .
<speaker2> What size do you want ?
<speaker1> I wear size 40 .
<speaker2> How about this one ? It's the latest design .
<speaker1> Oh , I like the color .

<speaker1> May I help you ?
<speaker2> I'm looking for a pair of shoes .
<speaker1> What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale .
<speaker2> I wear size 36.This pair looks nice.Can I try them on ?
<speaker1> Of course , yes.They look nice.And they're not expensive .
<speaker2> How much are they ?
<speaker1> They are $ 168 .
<speaker2> I'll take them .

<speaker1> A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ?
<speaker2> I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ?
<speaker1> Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals .
<speaker2> Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills .
<speaker1> Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance .
<speaker2> Ok , then we can sign up for it together .

<speaker1> Who's it knocking at the door ?
<speaker2> I think it's the postman.Will you go and open the door ?
<speaker1> All right . I'll get it .

<speaker1> Good evening . Welcome to Cherry's . Do you have a reservation ?
<speaker2> No , we don't .
<speaker1> How many of you , please ?
<speaker2> Six , including two kids .
<speaker1> I'm afraid all the big tables are taken .

<speaker1> Hi , I think I was supposed to call for my test results today .
<speaker2> If you go onto our website and put in your password , you can access your test results .
<speaker1> Are you saying that there weren

<speaker1> This is our rock-bottom price , Mr . Lee .
<speaker2> If that's the case . there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off .
<speaker1> What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great .
<speaker2> I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ?
<speaker1> What's your proposal ?
<speaker2> Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . Well , I suggest we meet each other halfway .
<speaker1> Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible !
<speaker2> What would you suggest ?
<speaker1> The best we can do is another 30 dollars off . That's definitely the lowest we can go .
<speaker2> That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with .
<speaker1> OK . We can meet halfway again .

<speaker1> Hello .
<speaker2> Good morning , Ruth . Did I wake you up ?
<speaker1> No , I was just about to get up . What's up , Carl ?
<speaker2> Listen , I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday . Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus ?
<speaker1> B as in boy . You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown .
<speaker2> Oh , you mean Canal Street ?
<speaker1> That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown .
<speaker2> Oh , I get it . When did we decide to meet ?
<speaker1> At 10,45 . Is Ann coming along ?
<speaker2> I cannot get hold of her yet .
<speaker1> See you around , Carl .
<speaker2> See you later .

<speaker1> Has your company been affected much by government legislation ?
<speaker2> Yes , we have . We've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards .
<speaker1> What about your use of raw materials ?
<speaker2> Well , we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we ' re not allowed to use lead in our products any more .
<speaker1> What happens if you exceed the limits ?
<speaker2> We try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine .

<speaker1> Have you got any better ?
<speaker2> That's the best there is .
<speaker1> Okay , I'll take one .
<speaker2> That'll be $ 200 , sir .

<speaker1> Good morning , sir . Sorry to disturb you . May I make up the room now ?
<speaker2> Yes , please . We're on our way out , so we put the ' make up ' sign on . Could you bring us some towels and hangers ?
<speaker1> No problem , sir . Everything will be ready when you come back .

<speaker1> What are the factors that have great impact on the perspective of this corporation ?
<speaker2> External factors . I think the main external factors are political , economic , social and technological factors .
<speaker1> What are the internal factors that influence the company ?
<speaker2> The internal factors are composed of human resources , team spirit , innovation spirit and coordination between different departments , etc .

<speaker1> I don
<speaker2> t want mommy , very quickly if I do something that he doesn
<speaker1> t know what to tell you . Of course Tony is a young child . But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason .
<speaker2> Yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable .
<speaker1> I suggest you treat him with patience , affection , and respect . If he needs to do something , like go to bed , or be washed , etc . , please guide or help him to get it done , but lead him with gentleness .
<speaker2> It
<speaker1> t work , instead he picks up another bad habit .

<speaker1> How can I help you ?
<speaker2> Yes , I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates . I would like to see Mr . Smith .
<speaker1> Do you have an appointment ?
<speaker2> Yes , he knows I'm coming . Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock .
<speaker1> I wonder if Mr . Smith forgot your meeting . I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm . Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . Will you please have a seat ?
<speaker2> Sure .
<speaker1> Yes , Mr . Mason , I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry , she said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She could be with your shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ?
<speaker2> That would be very nice . Thank you .
<speaker1> Right this way , Mr . Mason . We can start with our front office . When Ms . Terry is ready , you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor . There is a conference room already prepared

<speaker1> did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ?
<speaker2> no , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend .
<speaker1> yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go .
<speaker2> they must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood .
<speaker1> they're also one of the richest couples . They have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want .
<speaker2> I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars .
<speaker1> did either one of them win an Oscar this year ?
<speaker2> I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything .
<speaker1> Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?
<speaker2> yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous .
<speaker1> I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves .
<speaker2> people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated .
<speaker1> I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .
<speaker2> that's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go .
<speaker1> thank goodness we're not rich and famous !
<speaker2> being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich .

<speaker1> Next , please .
<speaker2> Could I purchase Euro with RIB here ? I have to stay here for months .
<speaker1> Yes , the rate for cash purchases is listed on the electronica screen , so you have seen the rate of exchange .
<speaker2> Yes , I have known of it .
<speaker1> How much do you like to exchange ?
<speaker2> 20,000 RIB .
<speaker1> In what denominations ?
<speaker2> It doesn't matter , but leave me some small changes , that will be convenient in daily life .
<speaker1> Right , I will exchange for you now . Please sign the exchange form giving the name and telephone .
<speaker2> Well , could you change them too ? The dollars , I want to change them into Swiss francs .
<speaker1> OK , wait for a moment . Well , I am sorry , but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins . In this case , you'd better change 2,000 $ to Swiss francs .
<speaker2> It doesn't matter .
<speaker1> Please sign the memo on the bottom and keep your money and memo .
<speaker2> Thanks a lot . Good-bye .

<speaker1> Why are you holding me in this jail cell ?
<speaker2> We'd like to hear your account of the events of last night .

<speaker1> I have to go up to London for a couple of days next week . Would you like to come ?
<speaker2> That would be nice . How are you getting there ?
<speaker1> Well , I prefer to go on the train , but I suppose you want me to take the car .
<speaker2> Oh , I much prefer to go by car , then we don't need to get to the station with our luggage and ...
<speaker1> And I've got to drive . You know I'm not fond of that . I found it much more relaxing to sit in the train .
<speaker2> Which is more expensive ?
<speaker1> But very much quicker . But I know we'll never agree on this subject . You prefer the car . I prefer the train .
<speaker2> Now , have you ever thought of going by express bus ?

<speaker1> I want to take a look at that home with the Open House flags out front .
<speaker2> What a wonderful neighborhood ! Can you find that house on our Open House list ?
<speaker1> Yes , that is one of the houses that we have on our list .
<speaker2> They always make the front yards look so great for Open Houses . Let

<speaker1> Hello . This is Mrs . Wilson . I'd like to buy a new car . Could you offer me a new type of the car , please ?
<speaker2> Oh , Madam , buy what ?
<speaker1> A new car . And I've got a small family , two children , and I haven't got a lot of money and ...
<speaker2> Oh , oh , Madam , Madam , I'm afraid you have the wrong number .
<speaker1> Isn't this the car store ?
<speaker2> No . It's Mike's Sporting Goods .
<speaker1> Oh , sorry . Do you know the number for a car store , then ?
<speaker2> No . I don't . I suggest you look in the phone book .
<speaker1> I'm sorry to have bothered you .
<speaker2> No problem .

<speaker1> How about going to the cinema tonight ?
<speaker2> That's great . What's on tonight ?
<speaker1> I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one .
<speaker2> Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better .
<speaker1> Don't you think it's too bloody ?
<speaker2> On the contrary , very exciting .

<speaker1> I am really interested in buying this television .
<speaker2> That's so great !
<speaker1> How much are you selling it for ?
<speaker2> This t . v is only $ 2500 .
<speaker1> You can't be serious .
<speaker2> That's how much this t . v costs .
<speaker1> That's too expensive for me .
<speaker2> This television is of very high quality .
<speaker1> You can't go down on the price .
<speaker2> By how much ?
<speaker1> I'll buy it for $ 2000 .
<speaker2> I'm sorry , but the price is final .

<speaker1> Did you pack this bag yourself ? Has it been out of your possession at any time before checking-in ?
<speaker2> Yes , I packed it myself , and it hasn

<speaker2> It

<speaker1> Hello.Is Bob there , please ?
<speaker2> Hold on a second please . I'm sorry . He has gone out .

<speaker2> He will be back at about seven o'clock .
<speaker1> Can I leave a message please ?
<speaker2> Yes , certainly .
<speaker1> Please tell him I'll call him at the office tomorrow afternoon .
<speaker2> All right . I'll tell him when he comes back .
<speaker1> Thank you very much .

<speaker1> Hey , son , are you insured ?
<speaker2> Not yet , but I'm thinking of it . Have you bought one , Dad ?
<speaker1> I took out a life insurance policy and made your mother the beneficiary .
<speaker2> Can you tell me why you want to buy it ?
<speaker1> I am a fireman and it is a dangerous job . I have to consider your mother's life .
<speaker2> Oh , I see . Do you advise me to buy one ?
<speaker1> You have children now . What if something , God forbid , happens to you ?
<speaker2> That's true . Well , how much do you think I should get ?
<speaker1> A $ 100 000 policy shouldn't be too expensive . Here , call my agent . He'll give you a good deal .

<speaker1> Excuse me , Mr . Emory ? Mr . Macmillan , would like to know if you have the completed schedule for next week ?
<speaker2> Yes , I do , Susan . Just a moment . Here it is .
<speaker1> Thank you , sir . Sorry to trouble you .
<speaker2> Not at all , Susan . Just tell him to leave it with my secretary when he

<speaker1> Where are you going , Jane ?
<speaker2> I'm going to the hospital to see Susan .
<speaker1> I saw her yesterday.She was a little better .
<speaker2> Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there ?
<speaker1> No , you needn't . A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital .
<speaker2> Number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ?
<speaker1> Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus .
<speaker2> Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 .
<speaker1> But number 13 buses leave from the center of town.You ' ll have to walk two miles to catch one .

<speaker1> Good morning , Passport , please .
<speaker2> Here you are .
<speaker1> Ah , thank you.Please bring your luggage here for inspection .
<speaker2> Ok.But is there anything wrong ?
<speaker1> It's just a regular inspection . Do you have anything to declare ?
<speaker2> I've got 6 packets of cigarettes and 2 bottles of champagne.Besides , I have two cameras , one is for my own use , and the other is a gift .
<speaker1> Well , the cigarettes and the champagne are not in excess of the duty-free allowance . But according to our law , each passenger is allowed only one camera duty-free.You ' ll have to pay duty for the other one .
<speaker2> Ok . Where shall I pay duty for it ?
<speaker1> Please wait a minute . I'll make out the duty memo ... Here you are.Take this and pay to the woman over there .
<speaker2> I've paid for it . Here's the receipt .
<speaker1> Very well . I hope you ' ll enjoy your stay in America .
<speaker2> Thank you .

<speaker1> Hello , Nancy , nice to see you .

<speaker2> I am great ! How about you , Mary ? How are you ?
<speaker1> I am doing great ! Thank you for asking , Joe .
<speaker2> I was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight ?
<speaker1> I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper .
<speaker2> OK . What about going to the movies on Friday night ?
<speaker1> What were you planning on seeing ?
<speaker2> I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer .
<speaker1> How about “ The Secret Life of Bees ” ?
<speaker2> That's a chick flick !

<speaker1> What do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ?
<speaker2> First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations .
<speaker1> That
<speaker2> ll need someone to hire staff .
<speaker1> I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that . I don
<speaker2> t be familiar with the type of people we employ . Have we decide on the location of
<speaker1> Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD .
<speaker2> Why didn
<speaker1> Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month .
<speaker2> When will the branch office open ?
<speaker1> Hopefully next month . Everything is a little rushed . We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly .
<speaker2> Has and advertising campaign been prepared ?
<speaker1> Yes , it has . We

<speaker1> Good afternoon . what can I do for you ?
<speaker2> I want to pick up my valuables .
<speaker1> May I have your key please ?
<speaker2> Sure . Here you are .
<speaker1> Here is your valuable . Is that right ?
<speaker2> Yes , thank you .

<speaker1> did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA ?
<speaker2> why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that .
<speaker1> well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers .
<speaker2> do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ?
<speaker1> no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions .
<speaker2> it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America .
<speaker1> religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal .
<speaker2> what do you think about abortion ?
<speaker1> I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself .
<speaker2> do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ?
<speaker1> I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children .
<speaker2> why not ? It's their children , too .
<speaker1> that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand .
<speaker2> that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter .

<speaker1> Come to think of it , you should get out your English books and catch up on your reading assignments .
<speaker2> But I don't have any reading assignments .
<speaker1> Then review for your test . You'll do even better . And maybe reading will help you get to sleep .
<speaker2> Aw , Mom-you're such a drag .
<speaker1> You say that now , Lily , but you'll thank me later . I'm your mom , and mother knows best .

<speaker1> I'm just calling to see if you have made any decision about the position .
<speaker2> Sorry , we haven't made the decision at all .
<speaker1> Do you have any idea when you might arrive at a decision ?
<speaker2> We will let you know probably next Monday . I hope to give you a positive reply .
<speaker1> I'm willing to wait until you have come to a decision .

<speaker1> How did you find your apartment ?
<speaker2> You can check on the bulletin boards at school for local housing .
<speaker1> What if I need a roommate ?
<speaker2> There are websites that can hook you up with a roommate .
<speaker1> How much do apartments cost around here ?
<speaker2> It depends on what you want . Do you want a one - or two-bedroom apartment ?
<speaker1> I just need a one-bedroom apartment .
<speaker2> That will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month .
<speaker1> Would you come with me to look at apartments ?
<speaker2> I would be happy to look at apartments with you .

<speaker1> Have you heard what happened ?
<speaker2> Heard what ?
<speaker1> Deborah already had her baby .
<speaker2> I didn't know that .
<speaker1> I thought you knew .
<speaker2> I honestly didn't know .
<speaker1> The baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces .
<speaker2> That's good to hear .
<speaker1> Will you go and visit them ?
<speaker2> Of course I will .
<speaker1> I just wanted to give you the good news .
<speaker2> Thanks for letting me know .

<speaker1> How silly of you to jump out of the window !
<speaker2> But that was the first thing that came into my mind when I heard the shout earthquake !
<speaker1> Why not use staircases ? The terror was not so violent at that time .
<speaker2> That would be too late .
<speaker1> Maybe the situation is too urgent .
<speaker2> Yes , I think I should have jumped in any case .

<speaker1> I need to stop eating such unhealthy foods .
<speaker2> I know what you mean . I've started eating better myself .
<speaker1> What foods do you eat now ?
<speaker2> I tend to stick to fruits , vegetables , and chicken .
<speaker1> Those are the only things you eat ?
<speaker2> That's basically what I eat .
<speaker1> Why aren't you eating anything else ?
<speaker2> Well , fruits and vegetables are very healthy .
<speaker1> And the chicken ?
<speaker2> It's really healthy to eat when you bake it .
<speaker1> I guess that does sound a lot healthier .

<speaker1> The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here !
<speaker2> Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
<speaker1> That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It
<speaker2> s why the parking lot was flooded .
<speaker1> I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .

<speaker2> Yeah , a number of times .
<speaker1> What's he trying to pull anyway .

<speaker2> You said it . Ok , let's go in , Sandy .

<speaker2> You have much patience .
<speaker1> Wow ! Your calligraphy is very beautiful . It was worth the wait !
<speaker2> Thank you . Today I'm writing a kind of poem called a Chinese couplet .

<speaker2> This is an especially famous one . It says " May the passing days bring you health and longevity . May this season of renewal find you basked in riches . "
<speaker1> That's very nice . Is it for sale ?
<speaker2> No . I never sell my artwork .
<speaker1> Really ? Then what do you do with it ?
<speaker2> I give it away . Here , this one is for you .
<speaker1> Wow ! Really ? Are you sure ? Now I'll have a lucky year !
<speaker2> Remember , real luck must be created ( by ) yourself , and then it cannot be given or taken away ...

<speaker1> I often recalled the days when Tom and I were madly in love .
<speaker2> Very romantic ?
<speaker1> Yeah . He always tickled my finny bone with his college stories .
<speaker2> You married him for that reason ?
<speaker1> Definitely not . The most important thing was we loved each other .

<speaker1> It seldom rains this summer .
<speaker2> Yeah , some places are very short of water .
<speaker1> Because of pollution and other things , our environment has become worse and worse .
<speaker2> You see , This time I traveled to the West . When I looked out of the windows of the rain , all the lands that I could see are as dry as a bone .
<speaker1> It is serious .

<speaker1> I'm looking forward to summer vacation .
<speaker2> Me too .

<speaker1> My granny is such a kind-hearted person . She is willing to help .
<speaker2> She does have a heart of gold .
<speaker1> You can say that again .

<speaker1> Look at this newspaper article about this famous local medium . It says that she is really gifted and so popular now , that she is booked solid with appointments for the next twelve months !
<speaker2> You don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo , do you ?
<speaker1> Well , I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true !
<speaker2> Of course it does ! They tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house . I think most of the times they are just scam artists .
<speaker1> Well , historically it is a practice that many cultures share . Reading the tarot cards , in the east they would even read tea leaves ! I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar , and then read your ashes .
<speaker2> All superstitious nonsense ! I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks .

<speaker1> It is the most expensive .
<speaker2> Well , I don't want it then . Can I move to another pump ?
<speaker1> Yes , I can give you regular unleaded . But you have to back up the car a little .
<speaker2> Give me regular unleaded then . I will back up.Can you wash my windows for me ?
<speaker1> I'm sorry , sir . This is not a full service gas station . I will help you fill the gas , but we don't wash windows here .
<speaker2> Really ? Well , I guess I have to get used to it .

<speaker1> Mary , it's good to see you !
<speaker2> Josh and I were just on our way back home from the beach and thought we'd drop by .
<speaker1> I am so glad that you decided to stop by !
<speaker2> Yes , it has been a long time since we have seen you .
<speaker1> Mary , can I get Josh or you something to drink ?
<speaker2> Oh no , thank you . We aren't all that thirsty .
<speaker1> How about a little snack then ?
<speaker2> No , thank you , we just ate lunch a little while ago .
<speaker1> Well then , how is your family ?
<speaker2> Everyone is doing great . My sister finally had her baby .

<speaker1> Everything is now . I'm kind of sick of it .
<speaker2> Each ring has 3 small diamonds inside the band .
<speaker1> Oooh ! One for each of the zeros in 2000 ! Wow !
<speaker2> Stop making fun of me .
<speaker1> So find a guy to marry and you can get one !
<speaker2> I don't need a guy to buy a wedding ring !
<speaker1> Oh , I see . You're going to wear one and pretend you're married to try to attract guys .

<speaker1> I went to the tutoring service centre on campus today . And I got a job .
<speaker2> Congratulation . What will you do ?
<speaker1> They got me a part-time tutoring job , teaching an Australian businessman Chinese .
<speaker2> That's wonderful . I want to get a part-time job too . Tell me what I should do .
<speaker1> It's very simple actually . You can go to the service centre and have your name and job interest resisted . They will give you a call if any job comes up .
<speaker2> Good . I'll do it .

<speaker1> Has Robert ever missed coming to one of our parties ?
<speaker2> Only once or twice at the most .
<speaker1> Do you know why ?
<speaker2> I have no idea .

<speaker1> Wow ! What a beautiful scenic spot ! It's so open . And just breathe that fresh air , you can almost taste its freshness .
<speaker2> You can have a bird view of Guiling City from the top of the mountain .
<speaker1> Wonderful ! I'll often come here for mountain climbing .
<speaker2> You should . Many Guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the morning .
<speaker1> No wonder people say
<speaker2> Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky !
<speaker1> I didn't know you liked bird-watching .
<speaker2> I don't really . I just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . This place is full of it .

<speaker1> Hide me , Yi-jun ! The kids all think I'm the real Easter bunny !
<speaker2> Aw , that's sweet ! I knew your costume would be a success .
<speaker1> It's a success all right . The kids keep trying to catch me .
<speaker2> Yeah , I saw that . I thought you were playing a game with them .
<speaker1> Some game ! You try being tackled by ten kids at once !
<speaker2> Um , Holly ? Look behind you . They're coming this way .

<speaker1> hi , Bob , I am so glad that you came .
<speaker2> of course I'd come . I couldn't think of a better chance to see all my old friends .
<speaker1> yeah . It's hard to believe that it's been ten years since graduation . It feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas .
<speaker2> how time flies . But hey , how are things going with you ?
<speaker1> oh , where to start ? There have been ups and downs . I'm still trying to find my place in this world . It's only recently that I've been able to start settling down . How about you ? You still with Jenn
<speaker2> yeah , Jenny and I got married right after graduation . It was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . I was supporting us both while she continued her studies . But now things are getting better
<speaker1> oh , that sounds wonderful . I have always known you two would make it . I hope I can keep in better contact with you guys . I don't want us to drift apart again .
<speaker2> definitely ! Actually , we just moved into a new place . There's a house-warming party this Saturday , if you are free ? I know Jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party .
<speaker1> sounds great ! I'll be there .

<speaker1> I guess I'm just a little nervous . I'm giving everything I have to invoking , and ...
<speaker2> and what if it doesn't work out , right ?
<speaker1> Exactly .
<speaker2> You need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt . You know how I know ?
<speaker1> How ?
<speaker2> Because I won't let it fail .
<speaker1> But what about tomorrow ? What if Stars.com decides to go with WebTracker , and not us ?

<speaker1> Are you ready for the camping trip ?
<speaker2> All set . I've got my makeup , my Cds , and my portable TV set ...
<speaker1> Hello ! We're supposed to be getting back to nature .
<speaker2> Yeah , yeah . Anyway ... I'm packed . Are you ?
<speaker1> I've been packed for a week . All my stuff is in this backpack .
<speaker2> Let me see ... two books ... birdseed ?
<speaker1> That's trail mix !
<speaker2> Same difference . What's this ?

<speaker1> It's getting late . I really have to go .
<speaker2> I hope we'll get together again soon .
<speaker1> I hope so . A good journey to you !
<speaker2> Thank you .

<speaker1> I

<speaker1> How about you and Tom ? What time is your wedding ?
<speaker2> Don
<speaker1> s the matter ? So angry . I

<speaker1> Margaret , do you think I should enroll in the science course ?
<speaker2> Yes , I think so , If you want to graduated this year , you've got to take a science course .
<speaker1> Right , I figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses .
<speaker2> Well , I have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics.what you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors .
<speaker1> Yes , I really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school .
<speaker2> That's a problem .

<speaker1> What are you listening to ? Is that Beethoven or Mozart ?
<speaker2> It's Beethoven . Do you like it ?
<speaker1> I think Beethoven's music is incredible . I've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too . Do you believe that ?
<speaker2> I don't know about that , but I do think that it helps people relax .
<speaker1> What other kind of music do you listen to ?
<speaker2> Actually , I mostly just listen classical music . What about you ?
<speaker1> To be honest , I think classical music is too complicated for me .
<speaker2> What kind of music do you prefer then ?
<speaker1> I like pop music . Do you ?
<speaker2> Not really . I don't think pop music has much depth .
<speaker1> I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much .
<speaker2> How long have you been in to pop music , then ?
<speaker1> I've always been into it . Have you always liked classical music ?
<speaker2> Not really . When I was little , we didn't really listen to music at all .
<speaker1> So , how did you become interested in it ?
<speaker2> Well , when I was about 10 years old , I started playing the piano . I think that's how it all started .
<speaker1> Do you still play piano ?
<speaker2> Yes , it's one of my hobbies .

<speaker1> Hi Paul . How are you , friend .
<speaker2> Not good . My cousin is driving me up the wall .
<speaker1> How so ?
<speaker2> He stays up untill all hours of the night , and he never lifts a finger to help .
<speaker1> Have you talk to him about it ?
<speaker2> Not yet , but I have to soon . He's eating me out of house and home . I caught him reading the fridge again last night
<speaker1> Ahahah , Maybe that will help you lose weight .
<speaker2> This is no laughing matter , Nick .
<speaker1> Sorry Paul . I couldn't help it . So why doesn't he give you a hand ?
<speaker2> He watch the tob too much . Now really I don't know . But I can't handle this much longer .
<speaker1> Well , talk to him , and let me know what happens , OK ?

<speaker1> You're from New York , aren't you ?
<speaker2> Yes , that's right .
<speaker1> What do you suggest I should see in New York ?
<speaker2> Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ?
<speaker1> No , I don't like museums . They're boring .
<speaker2> Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ?
<speaker1> Ah ! That sounds interesting .

<speaker1> What's your favorite book ?
<speaker2> It's Gone With the Wind .
<speaker1> Why do you like it best ?
<speaker2> I enjoy the various characters and the plot .
<speaker1> Well . I like the Thom Birds best .
<speaker2> Is it very interesting ?
<speaker1> Sure . I like the writer's language , too .
<speaker2> If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book .
<speaker1> Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
<speaker2> That's a good idea . Let's go !

<speaker1> John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ?
<speaker2> Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ?
<speaker1> It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day .
<speaker2> You forgot all of about it , didn't you ?

<speaker1> I
<speaker2> s eloquent , too .

<speaker1> Could you tell me if you have ever taken a class from Dr . Miller ?
<speaker2> Yes . Are you going to be taking a class from him ?
<speaker1> Yes , but I have never taken his class before .
<speaker2> He is very interesting and challenging . Is that what you are looking for ?
<speaker1> Yes , that's what I need .
<speaker2> He is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade . Are you willing to study hard ?
<speaker1> Yes , I guess so .
<speaker2> What I really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher . Do you enjoy that in a teacher ?
<speaker1> Yes , I had a teacher like that before .
<speaker2> Did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience ?
<speaker1> No , I didn't , but that could be a good thing .
<speaker2> Well , take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you . Good luck !

<speaker1> Honey , what's wrong with you ?
<speaker2> I'm not feeling well . I'm very nervous .
<speaker1> Take it easy . We are going to have our own baby . You should be happy .
<speaker2> Yeah , I know .
<speaker1> The doctors and the nurses will help you . And I will be waiting for you right here , praying for you and our baby .
<speaker2> Thank you , dear . I feel better now .

<speaker1> The weather is terrible .
<speaker2> Yeah . It's been raining a lot these days .
<speaker1> I have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain .
<speaker2> Have you heard when it's supposed to get better ?
<speaker1> I saw the weather report , and it's going to rain for the next eight days .
<speaker2> That sucks so much . What are we going to do ?
<speaker1> I'm getting pretty bored . We should do something despite the rain .
<speaker2> I'm with you . What do you have in mind ?
<speaker1> I haven't been to the Mall in a long time . Let's go there .
<speaker2> That sounds good . They have a movie theatre there , so if we get bored , we can watch a movie .
<speaker1> Great . I'll stop by your place now .
<speaker2> Ok . Don't forget to bring your umbrella . The rain can start up again anytime .

<speaker1> Come in , come in , what can I do for you ?
<speaker2> Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ?
<speaker1> Yes , I am applying on it .
<speaker2> I wonder if I could enroll in it . I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior , but ...
<speaker1> Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up .
<speaker2> I know , but geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field .
<speaker1> Well , if you think you are ready , I'll let you enroll .
<speaker2> Oh , thanks , professor Donald . This is really very nice of you .

<speaker1> ... so , I said , let
<speaker2> Ve been waiting for him to call , but I still haven
<speaker1> t think he
<speaker2> t be so dramatic ! I
<speaker1> m sure he
<speaker2> t he call ?
<speaker1> But , you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes .
<speaker2> He
<speaker1> Ve really messed this up .
<speaker2> Come on , hon . Pull yourself together . It
<speaker1> s all my fault ! I can
<speaker2> s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I
<speaker1> m sure he
<speaker2> Ve ruined everything ...
<speaker1> do you hear something ?

<speaker1> what's wrong , Jerry ? You look so upset .
<speaker2> to be honest , I was just dumped .
<speaker1> oh , I'm sorry to hear that . You can go on a holiday to cheer you up .
<speaker2> no , thanks . I'm not in the mood for traveling .
<speaker1> come on . A trip will do you good . Are you doing anything this weekend ?
<speaker2> I was planning on doing a lot of wallowing .
<speaker1> well , my friends and I are planning on going to Shangri-La on Saturday . Do you want to come with us ?
<speaker2> where is that ?
<speaker1> not very far from here . We'll fly . It's about one and a half hours .
<speaker2> what's there to see ?
<speaker1> there is a large canyon , vast grasslands , ancient forests and mountain lakes .
<speaker2> oh , sounds nice .
<speaker1> yes , the scenery there is breathtaking . I have some pictures at home . You can come over and take a look if you like .
<speaker2> ok . Then I can make up my mind .

<speaker1> Did you have any kind of punishment in your life and studies ?
<speaker2> Yes , just once .
<speaker1> What was the reason ?
<speaker2> I once played truant when I was in college because I intended to organize a donation activity for the disaster-hit areas in Sichuan .

<speaker1> Do you want to hang out tomorrow ?
<speaker2> Oh , I can't . I have a date !
<speaker1> Really ? Wow with who ?
<speaker2> This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months . She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend .
<speaker1> Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ?
<speaker2> Yeah ! I signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! You fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat .
<speaker1> That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ?
<speaker2> It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy .
<speaker1> I guess it does seem logical . I'll have to check it out !

<speaker1> Well , I'm afraid I must be going now . I have no idea it was so late .
<speaker2> Stay for dinner with us .
<speaker1> I'm afraid I can't . I have a dinner party at seven tonight . You see , I am going to England the day after tomorrow .
<speaker2> Well , I won't keep you then . It was very nice of you to come to see me .
<speaker1> It has been a pleasure . Goodbye .
<speaker2> Goodbye . Thank you again for coming .

<speaker1> Honey , do you have a second ?
<speaker2> Sure ! Are you okay ? You seem a bit worried.What
<speaker1> Ve been thinking , and well , I think we need to start seeing other people .
<speaker2> What ? Why ? I mean , we
<speaker1> re happy together , aren
<speaker2> s just it , I
<speaker1> s not you , it
<speaker2> re breaking up with me because I
<speaker1> ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I
<speaker2> d only make you cry .
<speaker1> Baby , come on . Don
<speaker2> t leave me .
<speaker1> I can
<speaker2> m only doing this for you . I don
<speaker1> ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I
<speaker2> ll always love you . Goodbye .

<speaker1> Oh , my God . I can't take it any more .
<speaker2> What's wrong , honey ? Take it easy .
<speaker1> I am tired of doing that boring work . I just repeat doing counting everyday . It's so terrible .
<speaker2> Me too . But I think we can do something else for a change .
<speaker1> You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion . Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is ?
<speaker2> But you did a good job . You always perform the best in our company .
<speaker1> Yes , that's in the past . Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help .
<speaker2> Perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation .
<speaker1> I was full of ambitions before . But now I have no aim for my career .
<speaker2> Maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting .
<speaker1> That sounds interesting . But I don't know how to do that .
<speaker2> How about a training course ?
<speaker1> A training course ? That must be costly .
<speaker2> But it's worth it . Maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future .
<speaker1> OK , let's have a try .
<speaker2> OK .

<speaker1> Have you seen the new James Bond movie ?
<speaker2> Oh , yes . You ?
<speaker1> Yes . What did you think of it ?
<speaker2> I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it . What did you think of it ?
<speaker1> Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ?
<speaker2> Mmm . That's what I thought too . I really liked the car chase , and the opening credit sequence was very exciting . And I always enjoy watching Pierce Brosnan .
<speaker1> Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ?
<speaker2> Not as much as last time , actually . What's the name of the American actor who was in the supporting role ?
<speaker1> Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . Did you like him ?
<speaker2> Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together , don't you think ?
<speaker1> I don't know . I think the woman was better . She provided a good love interest . Lucky James Bond !
<speaker2> Yes !

<speaker1> My friend Jean is very beautiful .
<speaker2> What's her figure ?
<speaker1> Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too .
<speaker2> What's the color of her eyes ?
<speaker1> Dark blue .

<speaker1> Where are you going ?
<speaker2> I'm going to buy a CD .
<speaker1> Why not listen to music online ?
<speaker2> Then I will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line , isn't it ?
<speaker1> You can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you needn't pay for it .
<speaker2> I have downloaded one , but it still can't be listened .
<speaker1> In order to listen to music , you must have the necessary software .
<speaker2> Can you recommend some to me ?
<speaker1> Certainly . Realplayer is a good .
<speaker2> Can I download it ?
<speaker1> Yes , but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it .
<speaker2> I'll try it tonight .

<speaker1> What were you and Richard talking about earlier ? It looked intense .
<speaker2> Yeah , Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate .
<speaker1> Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ?
<speaker2> He asked me how long it took me to learn English .
<speaker1> But , you were born and raised in California !
<speaker2> Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes .
<speaker1> What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ?
<speaker2> You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice .
<speaker1> So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ?
<speaker2> I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it .
<speaker1> Are you sure he really got the message ?
<speaker2> Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English .
<speaker1> That's hilarious ! What did he say ?
<speaker2> He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good .
<speaker1> I'm glad . I bet he won't make that mistake again .

<speaker1> Could you tell me the origin of the Dragon-Boat Festival ?
<speaker2> Yes , it's a way to commemorate a great ancient romantic poet , and the race is a symbol of the attempt to save him .
<speaker1> I see.Did they succeed in the end ?
<speaker2> Of course not.He drowned .

<speaker1> What can I do for you today ?
<speaker2> I would like to use a computer .
<speaker1> Do you have your library card ?
<speaker2> I sure do .
<speaker1> There is a wait for the computers .
<speaker2> That
<speaker1> s it ? Thank you very much .

<speaker1> how are you doing , Christopher ?
<speaker2> to be honest , I'm really fed up with work at the moment . I need a break !
<speaker1> are you doing anything this weekend ?
<speaker2> I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job !
<speaker1> are you available on Sunday ?
<speaker2> yes , that's my only day off until Thursday .
<speaker1> ok , well , my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ?
<speaker2> that'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ?
<speaker1> it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city .
<speaker2> what should I bring with me ?
<speaker1> we've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger .
<speaker2> I can just use my beach towel . I love lazing around in the sun .
<speaker1> do you like surfing ?
<speaker2> I've actually never tired . Do you have a surfboard ?
<speaker1> we've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun !
<speaker2> I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ?
<speaker1> you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money .
<speaker2> ok , where and when should I meet you ?
<speaker1> we'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square !

<speaker1> I'm not really accustomed to the style of the new boss .
<speaker2> It'll take us all some time to get used to the change .

<speaker1> I give up ! I simply can't learn French !
<speaker2> Why do you say that ? I think you're making a lot of progress .
<speaker1> No , I'm not . I try and try and I still can't speak it very well .
<speaker2> Learning any language takes a lot of effort.But don't give up . Why don't we practise those dialogues together ?
<speaker1> Good idea . That might help .

<speaker1> He said I have a big nose . I wonder what that means .
<speaker2> You are interested in other people
<speaker1> t you ?
<speaker2> Does he mean I am inquisitive or I

<speaker1> Excuse me , I'd like to ask you a few questions about the city .
<speaker2> OK , please .
<speaker1> My wife wants to take the children to go shopping , where is the best place to go ?
<speaker2> I would recommend the mall , it's about 20 minutes , drive to the south in a taxi . It has a wide range of shops and restaurants .
<speaker1> Thank you . Also , we'd like to do some sightseeing while we're in town . Can you recommend some local attractions ?
<speaker2> How old are your children ?
<speaker1> I have a 10 - year-old boy and a 6 - year-old girl .
<speaker2> I would recommend a day at the zoo . It's fun for all the family . There is also a water park just outside the city if you would like a day trip .
<speaker1> It sounds marvelous . Thank you for your help .

<speaker1> Boy , it looks like everyone in your family is here , from young to old .
<speaker2> Easter's a good day for reunions . The family goes to church together .
<speaker1> And after church they come here for lunch ?
<speaker2> Yup , a big potluck buffet . And then-notice there are no children around ?
<speaker1> Yeah , what's up with that ?
<speaker2> The kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . Hide away , Yi-jun !

<speaker1> Hi ! I'm happy you could make it .
<speaker2> Well , I've been looking forward to seeing you .
<speaker1> What can I get you ?
<speaker2> I'd love a gin and tonic .

<speaker1> Could you please help me to check out the book ?
<speaker2> Sure , what's the author's name , please .
<speaker1> I can't remember that clearly . It probably be Charles ...
<speaker2> Charles Dickens ?
<speaker1> No , no , no . I'm not interested in literature .
<speaker2> OK , do you know the title of the book ?
<speaker1> Oh , sorry . I'm always absent-minded . I remember that I've put a note in my pocket .
<speaker2> So , show me the note please .
<speaker1> I can't find it now .
<speaker2> Oh , such bad luck , sir . Can you please name the category of the book ?
<speaker1> Let me see . It's not fiction . It's biography .
<speaker2> OK , I'll search it for you . A moment , please .
<speaker1> Thanks .

<speaker1> How do you decide what grade we get ?
<speaker2> I look at many things , attendance , quizzes , and tests .
<speaker1> What is the most important factor ?
<speaker2> Obviously I look for improvement as we go along , but I would like you to do your best from the beginning .
<speaker1> How can we keep track of our grades ?
<speaker2> The final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade ; homework , attendance , and quizzes total 60 percent .
<speaker1> What if we can't get to school ?
<speaker2> You can only miss one class without penalty .
<speaker1> If we have a major problem , will you let us know ?
<speaker2> I will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem .

<speaker1> We're thinking about going to America .
<speaker2> Have you thought about the cost ?
<speaker1> There is that .
<speaker2> I believe it'll be very expensive .

<speaker1> May I help you with something ?
<speaker2> I would like to return some books .
<speaker1> I
<speaker2> s for each book that is late .
<speaker1> That shouldn

<speaker1> This is such a beautiful day ! Great for sailing !
<speaker2> It sure is ! The water looks so nice ! Anchor the boat for a little while . I
<speaker1> ll just backstroke , it
<speaker2> s good . Don
<speaker1> s fine . Jump in !
<speaker2> Kathy ! Get back here ! I see a shark !
<speaker1> Ahahah ! ! ! Help me ! Help ! Bring the boat closer ! The shark is coming straight towards me !
<speaker2> It

<speaker1> what was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ?
<speaker2> my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate .
<speaker1> three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive !
<speaker2> well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive .
<speaker1> were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ?
<speaker2> I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ' t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood .
<speaker1> did your husband's family get to meet your family ?
<speaker2> my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed t
<speaker1> that makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ?
<speaker2> we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa .
<speaker1> you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ?
<speaker2> not at all , but we don

<speaker1> Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ?
<speaker2> I'd love to , the movies are smash hit .
<speaker1> Then let's go in .
<speaker2> I can't . I'm waiting for Paul , but he's late .
<speaker1> I'll say the movie's starting in the minute .
<speaker2> I know . I wonder what's keeping him .
<speaker1> Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ?
<speaker2> Yeah , a number of times .
<speaker1> What's he trying to pull anyway .
<speaker2> I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw .
<speaker1> Maybe you should start seeing someone else .
<speaker2> You said it . Ok , let's go in , Sandy .

<speaker1> So , you
<speaker2> s the purpose of your trip to the United States ?
<speaker1> I
<speaker2> s just had a baby . He lives in Minneapolis .
<speaker1> And how long do you you plan to remain in the United States ?
<speaker2> I
<speaker1> s my return ticket for the twenty-sixth of March .
<speaker2> And , who is sponsoring your trip ?
<speaker1> My brother , here , this is an invitation letter from him . I will stay with him and his family in their home .
<speaker2> Alright , tell me about the ties you have to your home country .
<speaker1> Well , I own a house . actually , I
<speaker2> m employed by Tornal as an engineer . Actually , I only have three weeks
<speaker1> s a bank statement showing my investments , and my bank balance .
<speaker2> I

<speaker1> Good afternoon , madam . How can I help you ?
<speaker2> Well , I am a bit out of shape . I'm thinking about getting some exercises to keep fit .
<speaker1> Oh , that's good news for us .
<speaker2> So what do you provide ?
<speaker1> First of all , we'll design a custom-made work-out plan according to your habits .
<speaker2> How can you get that done ?
<speaker1> Well , we give each of our customers a personal trainer who is qualified . And he will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan for your needs .
<speaker2> What else ?
<speaker1> Since everyone is different , your personal trainer will find you a suitable type of exercise equipment and teach you all the techniques to help you achieve your fitness level and goal .
<speaker2> Sounds pretty good . What about the charge ?
<speaker1> That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year .
<speaker2> Maybe one month . Just have a try first . Not too tough at the beginning .
<speaker1> Wise decision . You'll find it's totally worth it .

<speaker1> Do you watch a lot of TV ?
<speaker2> Not really . I could take it or leave it .
<speaker1> Not me . I have to have my TV and watch whatever comes on .
<speaker2> How can you do that ?

<speaker1> Hi . What's your name ?
<speaker2> My name is Jung Min . What's your name ?
<speaker1> My name is Jessica . It's nice to meet you .
<speaker2> Yes . It's nice to meet you too . Are you a new student too ?
<speaker1> No . I'm a sophomore . I take it you are a new student ?
<speaker2> Yeah . It's pretty exciting to be here .
<speaker1> Have fun while it lasts . The excitement wears off real quick . Especially after you see how much homework you get . Where are you from ?
<speaker2> I'm from Korea . My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here .
<speaker1> I have never been to Korea . I've been to Japan before , but never Korea .
<speaker2> Why were you in Japan ?
<speaker1> My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures .
<speaker2> That's pretty cool .
<speaker1> I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents .
<speaker2> Well , if you ever want to visit Korea , I would be happy to show you around .
<speaker1> Thanks for the offer . I'll keep that in mind . Oh , the professor is coming . We'll talk more after class .
<speaker2> Ok .

<speaker1> Guess who I saw just now ?
<speaker2> Who ?
<speaker1> John Smith , the escaped criminal .
<speaker2> That bad egg , who took the low road since he was a boy .
<speaker1> I think I must report to the cops .
<speaker2> Ok .

<speaker1> What do you think of this one ?
<speaker2> Eh , so so .
<speaker1> And this one ? Too flashy ?
<speaker2> Nah , not too flashy .
<speaker1> Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn
<speaker2> m trying to have a conversation with you .
<speaker1> And I
<speaker2> re yapping on about your new clothes !
<speaker1> Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon !
<speaker2> Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It
<speaker1> Ve been blabbering on since the first !
<speaker2> Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
<speaker1> Oh no you didn
<speaker2> t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don

<speaker1> Hello . Nice to see you again . I heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery . I hope everything
<speaker2> t go into detail , but it wasn
<speaker1> t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing .
<speaker2> I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital .
<speaker1> I certainly was ! However , the doctor gave me a list of food I couldn

<speaker1> How was the party ?
<speaker2> I had a fantastic time .

<speaker1> Hi , Monica , how is everything going ?
<speaker2> Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job .
<speaker1> Why ? You

<speaker1> Henry married Rose only after her father's money , didn't he ?
<speaker2> Yeah . But he soon feel regretted for it .
<speaker1> But he seems to be very happy with Rose .
<speaker2> He is more nice than wise .

<speaker1> Hello , is that Cathy speaking ?
<speaker2> Yes , is that you , Allen ?
<speaker1> Yes , how are you doing ?
<speaker2> Not bad .
<speaker1> Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening.Would you like to come with me ?
<speaker2> Sure.Thank you very much .
<speaker1> Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty.OK ?
<speaker2> Ok , see you .
<speaker1> See you .

<speaker1> The weather has been terrible this week .
<speaker2> Yeah , I'm worried . If it's like this tomorrow , our big outdoor party will have to be canceled .
<speaker1> Let's hope it clears up .

<speaker1> Is that pesky lady coming to the office again ?
<speaker2> Yeah , I'm afraid so .
<speaker1> If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude .
<speaker2> Yes , it is annoying .

<speaker1> Hi , Mr . Smith . what's new ?
<speaker2> Nothing particular . But , ...
<speaker1> What's the matter ?
<speaker2> I , I don't know how to explain it to you .
<speaker1> Go ahead . It's nothing serious . We are good friends , aren't we ?
<speaker2> Yes , of course . But I'm afraid I can't tell you .

<speaker1> How do you do ?
<speaker2> How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Ms . Smith . I
<speaker1> s nice to meet you , Mr . Stevens .
<speaker2> Please call me Jack . Have a seat , please .
<speaker1> Thank you .

<speaker1> Thanks for your hospitality .
<speaker2> You're welcome .

<speaker1> I'm terribly sorry to have caused you so much trouble .
<speaker2> That's all right .

<speaker1> Hey , what's new ?
<speaker2> Not much . Just sitting here eating some Chinese food . Is that the paper ? Why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope ?
<speaker1> Ok , wait a minute ... let's see . I'm a Taurus , and it says , Mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse Venus . I don't know what that means , but then it says , Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . Remember to be positive . Sounds good to me .
<speaker2> What about Gemini ? What's the prediction ?
<speaker1> Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful .
<speaker2> That sounds bad ! I'm really worried , what should I do ? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day .
<speaker1> But we have a date tonight ! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope .

<speaker1> Lily , can you take part in our picnic this weekend ?
<speaker2> That sounds great . Where are you going ?
<speaker1> I think we can go to the river , go around and have supper .
<speaker2> What should I bring ?
<speaker1> Nothing . Just wear comfortable clothes and good shoes for walking . We'll bring everything .

<speaker1> What do you think of doctor Thomson ?
<speaker2> I feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter's disease .
<speaker1> How can you be so sure ?
<speaker2> I can tell form the way he spoke to us .
<speaker1> Never believe his words .

<speaker1> Should we ask Jason to play ? He's always watching movies on HBO .
<speaker2> I guess we should invite him . I just hope he doesn't start talking about Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger again .
<speaker1> Oh , come on ! The game is better with three people . Anyway , if we don't ask him to play , he'll be mad .
<speaker2> Yeah , you're right . We'll never hear the end of it .

<speaker1> What do you think about violence in movies ?
<speaker2> Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch .
<speaker1> But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ?
<speaker2> If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun .

<speaker1> Are you free tomorrow night ?
<speaker2> Yes , I am .
<speaker1> Shall we have dinner together ?
<speaker2> Do you have a special restaurant in mind ?
<speaker1> Yes , I do . I know a place that has excellent food .
<speaker2> OK . I'll be happy to join you .

<speaker1> If only our company prescribe flex time .
<speaker2> The board has been considering introducing flex time .
<speaker1> Good news . Ah , what if be even better if alternative work place is provided .
<speaker2> Then our entire job could be done by telecommuting .

<speaker1> Brian , do you know how to speak English ?
<speaker2> Yes .
<speaker1> Where did you learn ?
<speaker2> I learned in college .
<speaker1> You speak really well .
<speaker2> Thank you .
<speaker1> How long have you been in the U . S . ?
<speaker2> 3 weeks .
<speaker1> Is your wife with you ?
<speaker2> Yes , she just got here yesterday .
<speaker1> Have you been to California before ?
<speaker2> No . I've never been there .
<speaker1> Have you ever been to Las Vegas ?
<speaker2> Yes . I went there once on a business trip .

<speaker1> How are the children doing at sport ?
<speaker2> I
<speaker1> s very fast for a kid his age .
<speaker2> He
<speaker1> s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy
<speaker2> s fine for someone his age .
<speaker1> Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ?
<speaker2> The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
<speaker1> How are they at swimming ?
<speaker2> They
<speaker1> s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They
<speaker2> s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
<speaker1> Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
<speaker2> I
<speaker1> t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher .
<speaker2> It seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster , higher and further .

<speaker1> Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ?
<speaker2> Yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day .
<speaker1> Good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time .
<speaker2> Yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ...
<speaker1> Is everything ready now ?
<speaker2> Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive .
<speaker1> Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job .
<speaker2> Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet .
<speaker1> It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
<speaker2> That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ' t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
<speaker1> I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available .
<speaker2> Thank you .
<speaker1> My pleasure .

<speaker1> Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?
<speaker2> Sorry , I thought you knew .
<speaker1> But you should have told me you were in love with her .
<speaker2> Didn't I ?
<speaker1> You know you didn't .
<speaker2> Well , I'm telling you now .
<speaker1> Yes , but you might have told me before .
<speaker2> I didn't think you'd be interested .
<speaker1> You can't be serious.How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
<speaker2> Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .
<speaker1> Oh , you men ! You're all the same .

<speaker1> Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ?
<speaker2> Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic .
<speaker1> What about water pollution instead of pollution ?

<speaker1> How
<speaker2> m fine . Thank you .
<speaker1> Do you need anything ?
<speaker2> I need you to help me .
<speaker1> What can I do for you ?
<speaker2> I am looking for an article in a newspaper .
<speaker1> Did you check the periodicals ?
<speaker2> I didn
<speaker1> ll show you where to find your article .
<speaker2> I get lost in this library .
<speaker1> It

<speaker1> How about eating out for a drink with me tonight .
<speaker2> Tonight ? I'm afraid I can't . I've promised Mark to go to the gym . Can we make it tomorrow ?
<speaker1> No problem . Let's say 6:30 p . m . at the Royal Restaurant , OK ?
<speaker2> All right . See you tomorrow night .

<speaker1> Hi , Helen ! how is it going ?
<speaker2> I'm very busy these days . It seems I can never finish my work .
<speaker1> Well , take it easy ! Don't let it get on top of you .
<speaker2> I'll try . I'm under a lot of pressure right now .
<speaker1> Why don't you take a few days off ?
<speaker2> I can't . I am really behind of my work .

<speaker1> Can you speak Japanese ?
<speaker2> Yes , I can , but not very well .
<speaker1> Where did you learn it ?
<speaker2> At school . And I'm still learning it now .
<speaker1> How long have you been learning it ?
<speaker2> About three years .
<speaker1> Can you speak any other languages ?
<speaker2> I'm afraid not .

<speaker1> Good afternoon , Johnson .
<speaker2> Good afternoon , Mary . How's business ?
<speaker1> Not bad , thanks .

<speaker1> I'm too tired now . I've already worked for 12 hours overtime !
<speaker2> God ! Don't you think they should get you an assistant ?
<speaker1> Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day .
<speaker2> They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest .
<speaker1> I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project .
<speaker2> You'd better pay more attention to your health .
<speaker1> I will , thanks for your concern .
<speaker2> You're welcome .

<speaker1> It is too bad today .
<speaker2> What happened ?
<speaker1> My som was lost . I told him to stand rooted to the spot when I went shopping , but he ignored it .
<speaker2> How did you find him at last ?
<speaker1> It was the police wo helped me to do that .
<speaker2> It must have taught you a lesson this time .

<speaker1> I want to give our kitchen the works .
<speaker2> Why ? I think it
<speaker1> s modern .
<speaker2> Why should we run after the fashion ?
<speaker1> I am not running after the fashion . I just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen .

<speaker1> Rock music really leaves me cold . What about you ?
<speaker2> I'm crazy about it.It makes me very excited .
<speaker1> Then tell me what's good about it .
<speaker2> It can't be expressed by words .

<speaker1> What's wrong with Debbie today ? She seems upset about something .
<speaker2> I have no idea . Maybe she had a fight with her husband .

<speaker1> Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one .
<speaker2> Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal .
<speaker1> Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
<speaker2> I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won
<speaker1> ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .

<speaker1> Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ?
<speaker2> Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well .
<speaker1> Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion .
<speaker2> That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic .
<speaker1> Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert .
<speaker2> Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner .

<speaker1> Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?
<speaker2> What ? Why do we have to do that ?
<speaker1> Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .
<speaker2> I see . That
<speaker1> s eight time zones east of Greenwich !
<speaker2> That
<speaker1> s like we went back in time !

<speaker1> I would like to watch the Oscars on tv tonight . How about you ?
<speaker2> Yes , I
<speaker1> s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
<speaker2> I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .
<speaker1> Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ?
<speaker2> I
<speaker1> re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What
<speaker2> s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the best actor and actress .

<speaker1> How many cleaning ladies does your company hire ?
<speaker2> We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education .
<speaker1> Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job .
<speaker2> But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things .

<speaker1> How do you celebrate national day in your country ?
<speaker2> There are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building .
<speaker1> What kinds of parades are there ?
<speaker2> The parades are usually military ones , but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs . What do you do on national day in your country ?
<speaker1> We don
<speaker2> s unusual .
<speaker1> I guess it is . Most countries have on , but we don

<speaker1> Hi Melissa , are you going home this weekend ?
<speaker2> No , not this weekend . I have too much work to do .
<speaker1> Where do your parents live ?
<speaker2> My father lives in Washington DC .
<speaker1> How about your mother ?
<speaker2> My mother died two years ago .
<speaker1> Oh , I am sorry to hear that . Is your father still working ?
<speaker2> No , he's retired .
<speaker1> Do you have any family here ?
<speaker2> Yes , two of my cousins live here and my aunt and uncle live about 30 miles from here .
<speaker1> Do you have any brothers or sisters ?
<speaker2> Yes , I have two brothers who live in New York and a sister who lives in Boston .
<speaker1> Do you see them a lot ?
<speaker2> Not as much as I'd like to . Usually just on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas .

<speaker1> Hey , how was the show ?
<speaker2> Not great . It's a kind of boring .
<speaker1> Really ? I heard it was supposed to be great .
<speaker2> Yes , me too . But I'm disappointed .

<speaker1> What happened , John ?
<speaker2> Nothing .
<speaker1> Why do you look unhappy ?
<speaker2> I
<speaker1> ll understand you .
<speaker2> I hope so .

<speaker1> You know that ? Joan has got the scholarship .
<speaker2> Really ?
<speaker1> But I think Henry is a backroom boy.He always helps her with her study .
<speaker2> You're right .

<speaker1> Hi , Tina , I
<speaker2> s go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ?
<speaker1> Yes . Wait for me at the cafe down my office building . See 5PM , ok ?
<speaker2> No problem . See you !
<speaker1> See you !

<speaker1> Do you like ethnic food ?
<speaker2> I do ! My favorites are Mexican , Thai , and Indian .
<speaker1> Really ? Have you ever tried Moroccan ?
<speaker2> I can't say that I have . What are the basic ingredients ?
<speaker1> I don't know . A friend of mine said I should try it .
<speaker2> Do you know where a Moroccan restaurant is ?
<speaker1> As a matter of fact , he gave me this address .
<speaker2> Let's go there for lunch ! I'm up for an adventure !

<speaker1> Nicole , your Fettucini is very ... unique .
<speaker2> But not as good as your mother's , right ?
<speaker1> Actually , it's better ...
<speaker2> What ? Are you kidding ?
<speaker1> No . It was the only dish she wasn't good at . So we could use you as the new head chef ...
<speaker2> Oh , Uncle Giovanni . That's wonderful ! Thank you ! Thank you !
<speaker1> OK , OK . Get back to work . There's someone waiting for you in the kitchen ...

<speaker1> How many people are there in your family ?
<speaker2> Five.My father , mother , brother , sister-in-law and me .
<speaker1> Is your brother older or younger than you ?
<speaker2> He is five years older than me , He got married last Sunday.My brother and my sister-in-law are the same age .

<speaker1> Hello , Tom . Where are you heading for ?
<speaker2> I am going to a movie theater . You know there is a new action film produced by Hollywood . A thriller , really .
<speaker1> Another terror film ? There is too much terror and violence in the films . Do you like seeing such a picture ?
<speaker2> I don't really like seeing bloody frames , but I appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects .

<speaker1> Did you go to the concert last weekend ?
<speaker2> No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ?
<speaker1> Yes . I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist .
<speaker2> How much was the ticket ?
<speaker1> I only paid two dollars for mine .

<speaker1> Mary and Tom are breaking up .
<speaker2> It's unbelievable ! They are only married for one month . Then who is at fault ?
<speaker1> Mary said she couldn't put up with Tom , for he fell in love with another woman .
<speaker2> Do you think they'll become reconciled ?
<speaker1> No , I don't think so . She said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage .
<speaker2> What a shame ! Their marriage is really a mistake .

<speaker1> have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ?
<speaker2> sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality .
<speaker1> as far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ?
<speaker2> to begin with , I have to use chopsticks .
<speaker1> but you look quite proficient in using them now .
<speaker2> certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Ch
<speaker1> yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm i
<speaker2> anything strang about that ?
<speaker1> maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present .
<speaker2> oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks .

<speaker1> It really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens . I even want to wring his neck .
<speaker2> Don't be so angry . It's passed anyway .
<speaker1> I can't forget it .
<speaker2> You'd better cool yourself down first .

<speaker1> Let's program your courses . Since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction.You transcript indicate that your English background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it .
<speaker2> How many credits for each course ?
<speaker1> Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department .
<speaker2> Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will .

<speaker1> I hate to go outside .
<speaker2> Me too .
<speaker1> Why do you hate to go outside ?
<speaker2> I meet too many jerks .
<speaker1> I agree .
<speaker2> This city is full of jerks .
<speaker1> Rude people are everywhere .
<speaker2> But what can you do ?
<speaker1> You can yell at them .
<speaker2> And they will yell back at you .
<speaker1> Yelling doesn't do any good .
<speaker2> No . The best thing to do is just stay home .

<speaker1> I had to announce his innocence in court today , but it left a nasty taste in my mouth .
<speaker2> You mean you suspect him .
<speaker1> I
<speaker2> ll try to prove my feeling .
<speaker1> I hope I can do something for you .

<speaker1> Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature .
<speaker2> You do ?
<speaker1> Yeah , those classics from the great writers .
<speaker2> But I find Japanese ones better .

<speaker1> Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not .
<speaker2> Why doesn't he ask her ?
<speaker1> He is too scared to ask her .
<speaker2> He's a chicken guy .

<speaker1> Good morning .
<speaker2> Good morning .
<speaker1> What does the paper say ?
<speaker2> Nothing much — the same old stuff . A lot of bad news as usual .
<speaker1> Well , what
<speaker2> t the criminals after all .
<speaker1> What about the sports page ? What were the scores of last night
<speaker2> s the paper ; you can read them yourself .

<speaker1> I would wondering if you like to stay here for a few days .
<speaker2> It really depends on when and how long
<speaker1> Until next weekend . that

<speaker1> They
<speaker2> s important to do now . We can have a birthday party for you when you come out of the hospital .
<speaker1> But it won

<speaker1> I hate computer games .
<speaker2> Why ? They are fine .
<speaker1> Because they are too violent . Some of them are even disgusting .
<speaker2> Indeed there are bad games . But many of them are good .
<speaker1> If boys grow up with computer games , they will surely become bad .
<speaker2> Come on . Things are not so bad . Boys can learn to use the computer through games .

<speaker1> Are you free this weekend , Miss Rose ?
<speaker2> Yes , I am . What's up ?
<speaker1> Then would you please go to a dance party with me ?
<speaker2> With pleasure . I suppose you dance often .
<speaker1> Oh , no . As a matter of fact , I haven't danced for a long time .
<speaker2> But I am told that you dance wonderfully well .
<speaker1> Thanks for flattering me . I think you dance a lot , right ?
<speaker2> No . Just occasionally .
<speaker1> What's your favorite dance ?
<speaker2> It's hard to say , but I do love the foxtrot and waltz .
<speaker1> How about rock'n'roll ?
<speaker2> To tell you the truth , I don't like it . It's too noisy .
<speaker1> And the tango ?
<speaker2> Oh , it's really beautiful , but I just can't do it well .
<speaker1> Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can do it very well . Then I'll meet you at six . Is that at all right ?
<speaker2> OK .
<speaker1> Great ! I'm your lucky fellow then .

<speaker1> You are an outgoing person , quite easy to talk with .
<speaker2> Yes , my friends like to get along with me well .
<speaker1> Do you have many friends ?
<speaker2> Yes , I like to make new friends .
<speaker1> What do you usually do with them ?
<speaker2> We like to get together , chat and enjoy beautiful music .

<speaker1> Doris , Helen Mall is having a big sale this weekend . Do you wanna go ?
<speaker2> Don't feel like it . I'm broke .
<speaker1> Well , we can still do some window shopping , can we ?
<speaker2> Just look around ? Nah , that
<speaker1> " I

<speaker1> I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day .
<speaker2> Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink .
<speaker1> How about the new bar across the road ?
<speaker2> Sounds good . The food there is fantastic too .
<speaker1> I agree , I had lunch there last week .
<speaker2> Excellent ! That sounds like a plan .

<speaker1> Hello , are you Chinese ?
<speaker2> No , I'm Korean . Where are you from ?
<speaker1> I'm from America . Are you settling in all right ?
<speaker2> I've already found a flat and it's quite comfortable . What about you ?
<speaker1> I live in my uncle's house . He came here ten years ago .
<speaker2> What do you think of the local accent here ? Has it been causing you any problems ?
<speaker1> I think it's just a matter of getting used to it .
<speaker2> I can't agree more .

<speaker1> Why don't you watch where you're going ?
<speaker2> Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me !
<speaker1> There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .
<speaker2> Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me .
<speaker1> I think my arm is broken .
<speaker2> Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too .
<speaker1> Listen , let's just wait until the police get here.Then we can decide whose fault this accident was .
<speaker2> Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried .
<speaker1> I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?
<speaker2> Alright .
<speaker1> It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .
<speaker2> Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .
<speaker1> Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .
<speaker2> Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .
<speaker1> It really hurts .
<speaker2> Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?
<speaker1> To hell with you . The accident was your fault .
<speaker2> I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?
<speaker1> To hell with you .

<speaker1> Bill , do you know if the cafeteria around the corner's open today ?
<speaker2> Yes . They were open this morning when I came to work . They must've finished remodeling . Why do you want to know ?
<speaker1> Well , I thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today . That is , if you haven't promised to go with someone else .
<speaker2> That'd be wonderful , Peter . But I hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning .
<speaker1> I'm sorry I was such a grouch . It must've been the weather . When it rains I get depressed .
<speaker2> Forget it . I'll see you at 11:30 am .

<speaker1> The stepmother was very wicked . She couldn't stand a happy smile on the boy's face .
<speaker2> And ?
<speaker1> And she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
<speaker2> Poor child !

<speaker1> Sorry . I didn't mean to be late . Can I come in ?
<speaker2> What's your excuse this time ?
<speaker1> Have I used the one that my sister is sick ?
<speaker2> Yes , twice last week .
<speaker1> Are you sure ? I thought I said it was my mother .
<speaker2> I don't think so . But it could've been .
<speaker1> Well . You can trust me this time . My sister is definitely sick . I'm just coming from the hospital . They say she might even die .
<speaker2> I don't buy your story . Try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ?
<speaker1> I'll do my best .
<speaker2> Just try to be a little more punctual in the future .
<speaker1> I'm working on it . Really !

<speaker1> Hi , Becky , what's up ?
<speaker2> Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall .
<speaker1> What's the problem ?
<speaker2> She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she ' s around .
<speaker1> For example ?
<speaker2> Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .
<speaker1> No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
<speaker2> It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .
<speaker1> My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .

<speaker1> Ella , it's been such a long week . I'm ready to go out and party . Hey , let's go out for a night on the town .
<speaker2> Gosh , you took all the word right out of my mouth . Let's go out and get crazy tonight .
<speaker1> Let's go to the new club on West Street .
<speaker2> Sure , but what do I wear ?
<speaker1> You can wear that pretty red dress .

<speaker1> Hi , Alice , what are you doing this sunday ?
<speaker2> Nothing really , why , what ' s up ?
<speaker1> If you are free , maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party . It will be fun , you will get to know lots of people .
<speaker2> Sounds great , I'd very much like to accept your invitation , thanks , when ?
<speaker1> Around six pm .
<speaker2> Do you need help setting up or anything ? I don't mind . I like to do that kind of thing . It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating .
<speaker1> No . thank you . I can handle it , but thanks for the offer .
<speaker2> Ok , I will see you then .
<speaker1> Great , have a good day , thanks again for the offer .

<speaker1> Hello.this is Susan .
<speaker2> Hello , I
<speaker1> m just wondering if you are free this weekend
<speaker2> Yes , I think So .
<speaker1> Good . I was thinking that I
<speaker2> s the time ?
<speaker1> Six thirty , tonight .
<speaker2> Oh , I
<speaker1> t because I have to do some housework.You can ask Jenny to go with you
<speaker2> All right.Maybe next time I can go with you.Bye !
<speaker1> Good bye !

<speaker1> What is life ?
<speaker2> Don't ask such a question . You know it has no certain answer . Everyone knows it is in his heart .
<speaker1> Then do you think that life is arranged by something above us .
<speaker2> Maybe , the whirligig of time , who knows ?
<speaker1> Right .

<speaker1> David , I
<speaker2> t have to pay for my trip .
<speaker1> Congratulations . How lucky you are !
<speaker2> Thank you . I
<speaker1> m sure you
<speaker2> m sure I will .
<speaker1> Have a nice journey , Lily .
<speaker2> Thank you , David .

<speaker1> Did you watch the final last night ? My favorite singer won !
<speaker2> Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest .
<speaker1> Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions .
<speaker2> He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him .
<speaker1> Me too .
<speaker2> Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out .
<speaker1> Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?
<speaker2> Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited .
<speaker1> He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .
<speaker2> And the host announced that he won it all !

<speaker1> Come in , come in !
<speaker2> Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn
<speaker1> t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn
<speaker2> m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other .
<speaker1> Why don
<speaker2> re right . I am sorry . Let
<speaker1> s okay . I don
<speaker2> Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don

<speaker1> Excuse me , i am a new student here . Could you tell me where the English Department is ?
<speaker2> It is in that brand new , tall building over there . On the 9th floor .
<speaker1> Where is the school cafeteria ?
<speaker2> It is the basement of that red building in front of the tower with big bells .
<speaker1> Where is the Computer Center ?
<speaker2> The Computer Center is on the first floor of the library .
<speaker1> Where is the library ?
<speaker2> The library is next to the Adminstration Building . The Adminstration Building is over there near the school
<speaker1> d better go . Goodbye .
<speaker2> Have a good day . Bye-Bye !

<speaker1> How about another beer ?
<speaker2> No , thanks . I've had more than enough.In fact , I must be running along .
<speaker1> Stay around for a while.The party is warming up .
<speaker2> I'm afraid I have to leave . I have to be up early tomorrow .

<speaker1> We have another traditional holiday-the Dragon Boat Festival .
<speaker2> When is it ?
<speaker1> It falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month .
<speaker2> Could you tell me the origin of the two festivals ?
<speaker1> OK . The Dragon Boat Festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named Quyuan . On that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river .
<speaker2> Why do people eat rice cakes on that day ?
<speaker1> In order to prevent the fish from eating the poet's body .
<speaker2> It sounds so moving .

<speaker1> Nice to see you , Patrick .
<speaker2> Bob ! I hear your team won the match .
<speaker1> Yeah . All of us tried our best .
<speaker2> Congratulations !

<speaker1> I think you're being a little naive .
<speaker2> If I want , I can protect myself by paying through an escrow account , which holds the money until I receive the item .
<speaker1> That proves my point ! Protect yourself or you'll get burned .
<speaker2> eBay also offers free insurance . You can get a refund of up to $ 200 if you're not satisfied with your purchase .
<speaker1> $ 200 ? If they get a hold of your credit card number , you're going to be out a lot more than $ 200 ! I had a friend who ...

<speaker1> Your knowledge of English is really surprising .
<speaker2> Oh , it's nothing to speak of .
<speaker1> No , seriously . I am impressed .
<speaker2> Thank you . I appreciate the compliment .

<speaker1> Hello ?
<speaker2> Hey Tina . What are you doing ?
<speaker1> I was just watching TV . What's going on with you ?
<speaker2> I just watched a movie and I'm scared .
<speaker1> What did you watch ?
<speaker2> I saw the Sixth Sense . I didn't know it was going to be so scary .
<speaker1> I remember that . It was a great movie . But it was definitely scary .
<speaker2> If you're not busy , do you want to come over ? I'm afraid to be alone .
<speaker1> Sure . I can come over . What should we do ?
<speaker2> How about if we watch a comedy . I need something to get my mind off the frightening images I have from the Sixth Sense .
<speaker1> Ok . I'll get ready and leave . I'll see you in about 20 minutes .
<speaker2> Hurry , ok . It's dark out .
<speaker1> Don't worry , nothings going to happen . I'll be there real soon .
<speaker2> Ok . See you soon .

<speaker1> are you a blogger ?
<speaker2> sure I am . I've been writing a blog for almost three years .
<speaker1> oh , it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs . When did you get started ?
<speaker2> I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides .
<speaker1> what do you usually write about ?
<speaker2> at first , I'll write about my life there . Like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes , I'll post my pictures on my blog so my family an
<speaker1> that's interesting . How often do you write a blog ?
<speaker2> it's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks .
<speaker1> got it . Are you still updating your blog ?
<speaker2> sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like .
<speaker1> good for you . I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months .

<speaker1> Have you found a new job yet ?
<speaker2> No , not yet . I
<speaker1> Ve been doing some work through a temp-agency though .
<speaker2> What kind of work ?
<speaker1> I

<speaker1> This is just for you . Cheers ! Bottoms up .
<speaker2> En ... it tastes good . I appreciate what you have done for me .

<speaker1> I'm sorry , ladies . Mr . Smith's viewing is over . It ended an hour ago .
<speaker2> But we just drove across town . Can't we just go in to see him one last ...
<speaker1> I'm afraid not . But at tomorrow's funeral , the family requested an open casket service .
<speaker2> This is all too fast . He's my best friend , and now he's gone .
<speaker1> I'm sorry . I know it must have come as a great shock .
<speaker2> The viewing was for saying goodbye , and I didn't even get that .

<speaker1> I can
<speaker2> s lucky that we will get off soon .

<speaker1> I prefer potatoes to eggplants .
<speaker2> I feel eggplants are more nutritious .
<speaker1> But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better .
<speaker2> Oh , that's how you see it .

<speaker1> That way they look longer .
<speaker2> Now what are you doing ?
<speaker1> Putting on mascara .
<speaker2> Nasty . You'd better not rub your eyes .
<speaker1> I won't .
<speaker2> And you'd better not cry or you'll have black streaks running down your face .

<speaker1> Let's have some lunch ; do you know of a great restaurant somewhere ?
<speaker2> Yes , I'm hungry . What types of food sound good ?
<speaker1> Maybe just a quick sandwich , salad , or something .
<speaker2> I have a great idea of where you might like to go .
<speaker1> Can we walk there ?
<speaker2> It's on the second floor . May I join you ?
<speaker1> Of course ! Let's go .
<speaker2> Let's hurry . I'm starving !

<speaker1> What are you going to do next year ?
<speaker2> I want to go traveling .
<speaker1> Do you have any where in mind ?
<speaker2> Yes , I've been thinking about Florida .

<speaker1> Like a cat on hot bricks , as you might say . I don
<speaker2> t worry him , he has been grown up and I think he can take himself very well .
<speaker1> But he still does not come back .
<speaker2> Maybe he is on the way home now .

<speaker1> How long have you been in England ?
<speaker2> For almost two years .
<speaker1> Almost two years ? Your English is very good .
<speaker2> Thank you . But there's still a lot for me to learn .

<speaker1> The Johnson are on their way back.You remember them , don't you ?
<speaker2> Johnson ? I can't place them .
<speaker1> We met them in Bermuda last May .
<speaker2> They've completely slipped my mind .
<speaker1> The couple with the dogs , think back .
<speaker2> No , I don't recall a thing about them .
<speaker1> Well , I've invited them for brunch .
<speaker2> Hmm , I must be getting absent-minded .

<speaker1> His grandfather is the richest person in the area .
<speaker2> What a miser ! He cycles to school every day .
<speaker1> His grandfather's money is not his .
<speaker2> I can't understand him anyway .

<speaker1> What did he say ?
<speaker2> He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
<speaker1> It

<speaker1> I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat.oh , there he is .
<speaker2> hey , Isabelle ...
<speaker1> Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true .
<speaker2> yes , I am the guy ...
<speaker1> what a bummer ! You set me up ?
<speaker2> let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ...

<speaker1> We are just going round the corner for a drink . Won't you join us ?
<speaker2> Well , I'd like to , but I am not sure I have time .
<speaker1> Oh , come on ! Just a quick one !
<speaker2> All right , just a quick one .

<speaker1> Excuse me Miao Li . Could you tell me who Jackie Chan is ?
<speaker2> Certainly . Jackie Chan is a very famous movie star in Hong Kong . His Chinese name is Cheng Long .
<speaker1> Ha , I know Cheng Long a lot , he has made 40 films since 1976 . And at that time he was promoted as the new Bruce Lee . But I'm not familiar with his English name .
<speaker2> OK . Then tell me what else you know .
<speaker1> Some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make . Do you know how Jackie Chan measures his worth ?
<speaker2> He measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film , incredible stunts . By the way , can you count the breaks ?
<speaker1> Sure . His skull , his eyes , his nose , three times , his jaw , his shoul-der , is chest , two fingers , a knee . As he said ' Everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet ! '
<speaker2> Indeed you know much about him .
<speaker1> This is because he is the action-movie incarnate or action-star extraordinaire around the world .

<speaker1> I'm sorry , but I can't find the book you lent me .
<speaker2> Oh , that's all right .
<speaker1> I must apologize . I'll buy you a new one tomorrow .
<speaker2> No , please don't . I couldn't let you do that .

<speaker1> May I ask a question ?
<speaker2> Yes , what's it ?
<speaker1> What does mph stand for ?
<speaker2> It's miles per hour .

<speaker1> Look , that bamboo groves are flourishing . Let's go and play there .
<speaker2> Wait ! Look at that board , what's on it ?
<speaker1> ' Please don't enter the bamboo groves . ' We're not allowed to go in .
<speaker2> Then we'd better not go .
<speaker1> OK .

<speaker1> Are you ready to go shopping ?
<speaker2> Not yet . I'm not finished with my research yet .
<speaker1> What research ?
<speaker2> Reading my fashion magazines ! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends ?
<speaker1> But they're just ads .
<speaker2> Duh ... That's the point . The people in the ads are wearing what's in . Plus , there are articles on new trends .

<speaker1> Is there anything worth watching on another channel ?
<speaker2> I think there
<speaker1> d really like to see it .
<speaker2> Well , I really wanted to see the football game .
<speaker1> Football game ? Ok , and you know what comes on next ?
<speaker2> I believe there
<speaker1> " Oh , I am sorry . What
<speaker2> s a quiz show . "
<speaker1> " Let

<speaker1> Well , how did you enjoy your seaside trip ?
<speaker2> It was funny .
<speaker1> Tell me about it , will you ?
<speaker2> Well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . It was a magnificent sight .
<speaker1> Did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ?
<speaker2> Sure , we wouldn't miss it for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour .
<speaker1> You were lucky then . What did you do after that ?
<speaker2> We went for a swim in the sea . That was the best part of the day . Just look at my nice tan .
<speaker1> So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday .
<speaker2> Yes , you're right . And I was so tired that I fell asleep on the way back . My arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday .

<speaker1> Susan is going to get a divorce .
<speaker2> How do you know that ?
<speaker1> She told me that Peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage .
<speaker2> Oh , I see . But I think you are making a fuss . They will make it up . Bet it .

<speaker1> Here's the course description guide .
<speaker2> What do I do with it ?
<speaker1> Do you want me to help you ?
<speaker2> Please .
<speaker1> Look . Here are the core classes . Everyone has to take them .
<speaker2> So I don't have to worry about them .
<speaker1> You're catching on ! However , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics ...
<speaker2> I'll take home economics .
<speaker1> Good . Now you can pick classes by yourself .

<speaker1> Well , known , Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of your computers , I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thoughts .
<speaker2> But I ... I don't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids'ability to thinkbecause kids don't learn basic skills .
<speaker1> What do you mean ?
<speaker2> They can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more . that's because they rely on gadgets .
<speaker1> That's not the gadgets . Creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . It engages their imagination and sharpen their mind .

<speaker1> Ann , do you have time next Monday ?
<speaker2> Yeah , what
<speaker1> " Wow . I
<speaker2> Great !
<speaker1> When and where ?
<speaker2> Five o

<speaker1> Hey Stacy . What's going on ?
<speaker2> I'm pretty tired these days .
<speaker1> Why ? You're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands ?
<speaker2> I have so much house work to do . I have to take care of the kids , cook , clean , laundry , and the cycle never ends .
<speaker1> How about your husband . Does he help much ?
<speaker2> Not at all . He comes home and complains about his hard day at work . He expects me to do everything . He even wants me to feed him sometimes . Can you believe that ?
<speaker1> That sucks .
<speaker2> If he wasn't so lazy , I think I wouldn't have any complaints . He mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ?
<speaker1> That's crossing the line .
<speaker2> Oh well . I'll have to live with it . What else can I do ?

<speaker1> Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ?
<speaker2> Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ?
<speaker1> Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
<speaker2> That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems .
<speaker1> Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ?
<speaker2> When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports .
<speaker1> I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ?
<speaker2> Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it .
<speaker1> Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo .
<speaker2> Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits .
<speaker1> You should go to talk with May . She is a big fan of them too .

<speaker1> How do you arrange this summer vacation ?
<speaker2> I want to travel .
<speaker1> Where would you like to go ?
<speaker2> The seaside .
<speaker1> That's really a good idea . Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . I recommend you Qingdao or Dalian .
<speaker2> I ' Ve been to Qingdao before , so I ' ll choose Dalian . I've heard that the environment there is very good .
<speaker1> Yes , that's a good place to spend a holiday . Last year I went there . It's really .
<speaker2> Thank you !

<speaker1> Would you care for something to drink , Mr . Stone ?
<speaker2> No , thank you , Mrs . Carter . I'm fine for now .
<speaker1> Just make yourself at home . The other guests should be arriving shortly .

<speaker1> I'm dreadfully sorry for you .
<speaker2> Thank you very much for your kindness .
<speaker1> Is there any clue ?
<speaker2> No , he left nothing .

<speaker1> Very glad to know something about you , then what are you going to do when you finish .
<speaker2> Oh , I
<speaker1> s a good idea . It must be easy to find a job in shanghai .
<speaker2> I think so , you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there .
<speaker1> And English is very useful in your job .
<speaker2> I think it will be very useful in many ways . Beside , shanghai is an important trade center , not only in China , but also in the world , English is useful in almost all walks of life .
<speaker1> You will be a very promising one .
<speaker2> That

<speaker1> I hear you are expecting your family .
<speaker2> Yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well .
<speaker1> I didn't know you had a brother .
<speaker2> Oh , yes , he is two years older than me . He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often .
<speaker1> Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ?
<speaker2> His son is coming as well . He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here .
<speaker1> Does your brother have just one son ?
<speaker2> No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them .
<speaker1> I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson .
<speaker2> Oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . They went to New Zealand last year and loved it .
<speaker1> So when are they all coming ?
<speaker2> My parents are already here . My brother and nephew are arriving on Monday .

<speaker1> You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ?
<speaker2> I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday .
<speaker1> Where did you spend your holiday ?
<speaker2> I went to Paris .

<speaker1> So , Paula , where are you from ?
<speaker2> I'm from Canada , originally .
<speaker1> From Canada ? Where were you born ?
<speaker2> Montreal .
<speaker1> When did you come to Los Angeles ?
<speaker2> We moved here when I was fourteen .
<speaker1> Did you go to school here ?
<speaker2> Well , I went to high school here , but I went to college in Texas .
<speaker1> Did you get a job right after graduation ?
<speaker2> No , I traveled for a while in Europe after college , and then I lived in France .
<speaker1> When was that ?
<speaker2> Let's see ... That was about six years ago .
<speaker1> I bet that was interesting . What did you do there ?
<speaker2> I studied French . Anyway ... that's enough about me.How about you ? Were you born in L . A . ?

<speaker1> Do you consider yourself a good mother ?
<speaker2> Yes , I'm a very good mother and successful career woman .
<speaker1> How can you manage to do both ? I mean , it is so hard to be a working mother .
<speaker2> I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself .
<speaker1> Does your husband feel the same ?
<speaker2> Yes . He is very understanding and supportive .

<speaker1> I find it really hard to express myself in class . I have lots of ideas , but they never seem to come out of my mouth .
<speaker2> let me give you a little advice . You know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance .
<speaker1> I often do , but I
<speaker2> m worried that what I say will not make sense .
<speaker1> we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking .
<speaker2> that
<speaker1> s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle .
<speaker2> I didn
<speaker1> t be sure how .

<speaker1> What's his job ?
<speaker2> He used to be a policeman .
<speaker1> But Mrs.Smith hired him to find her lost son .
<speaker2> Yeah . He's a private eye now .

<speaker1> Bother the flies !
<speaker2> Where do they come from ?
<speaker1> I don't know . Something rotten here ?
<speaker2> I can't see it .

<speaker1> Have you got your invitation yet ?
<speaker2> My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ?
<speaker1> The house warming party .
<speaker2> Whose house warming party is it ?
<speaker1> Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house .
<speaker2> Oh , they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately .
<speaker1> It's out in the suburbs .
<speaker2> Have you seen the house ?
<speaker1> Yes , I have . I went out with them last weekend .
<speaker2> Is it nice ?
<speaker1> Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen .
<speaker2> There's also a garden .
<speaker1> Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ?
<speaker2> They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight .
<speaker1> When are they going to have the party ?
<speaker2> Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow .
<speaker1> Wow , that would be something to look forward to .

<speaker1> hi , darling ! I have a one-month vacation saved up . How about a trip to Europe ?
<speaker2> I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year .
<speaker1> oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ?
<speaker2> we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec
<speaker1> wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait !
<speaker2> tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ?
<speaker1> perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank .
<speaker2> no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know .
<speaker1> we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning .
<speaker2> great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain .
<speaker1> no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week .
<speaker2> Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us .

<speaker1> Hi , Kenny . Let's go for a drink .
<speaker2> Sounds good . Where are we going ?
<speaker1> Somewhere new . It's a great place to pick up chicks .
<speaker2> Need a new . girlfriend , huh ?
<speaker1> Yeah , I broke up with Lisa.She blew a gasket over it . Whoa , get a load of that !
<speaker2> Whew ! That getup is terrific !
<speaker1> Never mind the getup.She ' s beautiful !
<speaker2> That too .
<speaker1> I'm gonna introduce myself .
<speaker2> If you're lucky , that might do the trick .
<speaker1> Oh , oh , that tears it ! I'm getting out of here .
<speaker2> Hold on ! What's the big hurry ?
<speaker1> My ex-girlfriend's here.If she sees me , my goose is cooked .
<speaker2> I wanna finish my drink first . I'll meet you at Sammy's .
<speaker1> OK , catch you later .

<speaker1> Valerie ! Hi ! Wow how are you ? It
<speaker2> s been a while ! How have you been ? Wow , you look amazing ! I love what you
<speaker1> t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret !
<speaker2> Ha ha , come on ! Well , I
<speaker1> s been great talking to you , but I have to get going .
<speaker2> Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee !
<speaker1> That would be great ! Give me a call !
<speaker2> See you soon ! Bye ! Egg ... I can

<speaker1> Did you already take the history exam ?
<speaker2> Yeah . It was hard . When do you take it ?
<speaker1> I take it tomorrow morning . There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on . What types of questions did you get ?
<speaker2> Mostly on the civil war . You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr . had on American society .
<speaker1> What about Abraham Lincoln ? Did you get any questions about him ?
<speaker2> I only had 1 question about him . But you might get more . I dont know if he will have the same exam or not .
<speaker1> Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class .
<speaker2> If you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go .
<speaker1> Aright . Thanks for the info . I gotta go to the library now .
<speaker2> Good luck .
<speaker1> Thanks . See ya .

<speaker1> What's the matter with you , then ? You look miserable .
<speaker2> It's us .
<speaker1> What do you mean by " us " ?
<speaker2> Well , we used to talk to each other before we were married . Remember ?
<speaker1> What do you mean ? We ' re talking now , aren't we ?
<speaker2> Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together .
<speaker1> Yes . I remember . But we never used to argue . You used to think I was wonderful . Where are you going ?
<speaker2> Back to live with my parents . That's something else I used to do before we were married . Remember ?

<speaker1> Hey , Blake ! Are you still listening to Mozart ?
<speaker2> Yes.Do you like it ?
<speaker1> It's great . and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent .
<speaker2> Really ? I've never heard that before . I just like it .
<speaker1> Is classical music your favorite ?
<speaker2> Yes . What about you ?
<speaker1> I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it .
<speaker2> Pop music doesn't have any depth for me .
<speaker1> Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it .
<speaker2> Did you always like pop music .
<speaker1> I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music .
<speaker2> I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life .
<speaker1> oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play .
<speaker2> Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy .

<speaker1> It was really hard for our parents to save money when they were young .
<speaker2> Most people were living form hand to mouth . How could they ?
<speaker1> Yeah . They simply had no extra money to save up or for other things .
<speaker2> Fortunately , things are changing these years .

<speaker1> Jane , I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon .
<speaker2> A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ?
<speaker1> There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , I was hoping you ' d like to come with me .
<speaker2> I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day .
<speaker1> What about sunday ?
<speaker2> i wish i could , but it's my mums birthday .
<speaker1> Maybe next week .
<speaker2> Much as I ' d like to , I am afraid i wont be free next week , I have a lot of work .
<speaker1> Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat .
<speaker2> I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime .

<speaker1> Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ?
<speaker2> Yeah , I
<speaker1> ll have a great time this weekend .
<speaker2> Thanks , I

<speaker1> How upsetting ! He has been away for a week !
<speaker2> I don't know if anything terrible has happened .
<speaker1> I have reported it to the police .
<speaker2> We'd better prepare for the worst .

<speaker1> You've heard of Bruce Jenner , haven't you ?
<speaker2> He won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics , right ?
<speaker1> I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles .
<speaker2> I can think of better things to dream about ...
<speaker1> Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away .
<speaker2> That's crazy .

<speaker1> Mike ! Look at the floor !
<speaker2> What's wrong with it ?
<speaker1> What's wrong with it ? It's filthy !
<speaker2> Oh ...
<speaker1> It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
<speaker2> Sorry , love .
<speaker1> What are you looking for now ?
<speaker2> My cigarettes .
<speaker1> Well , they ' re not here.They are in the dustbin .
<speaker2> In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ?

<speaker1> Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at this university ?
<speaker2> Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad .
<speaker1> It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing .
<speaker2> Are you Chinese by birth ?
<speaker1> Yes , I am . I am from Guangzhou . I am here to study international relations .
<speaker2> How do you like it ?
<speaker1> I like it so far . But my English still needs work .
<speaker2> I want to study Mandarin and public relations .

<speaker1> Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look .
<speaker2> Sure . It's probably a skiing show . Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
<speaker1> Look at that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .
<speaker2> Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
<speaker1> You are right . But what if an avalanche happened ?
<speaker2> They are all great skiers and very experienced . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
<speaker1> Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow here ?
<speaker2> Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .
<speaker1> Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
<speaker2> It's possible .

<speaker1> You'll never guess what I won at work today ! - Tickets to tonight's final NBA game .
<speaker2> Two , I hope and I hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me !
<speaker1> Of course ! And here's the best part , they are court side seats !
<speaker2> How in the world ! Who came up with seats like that from your company ?
<speaker1> Some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team !
<speaker2> Can't beat that ! Thank you accounting guy !
<speaker1> The game starts at seven so we'd better hustle , it's already five .
<speaker2> What are we waiting for ? Let's go !

<speaker1> Let
<speaker2> m going to describe someone
<speaker1> s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples !
<speaker2> Our cousin Pete ! My turn ! She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin !
<speaker1> Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald !
<speaker2> Your future husband !
<speaker1> Not funny .

<speaker1> As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives .
<speaker2> It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points .
<speaker1> Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
<speaker2> For instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .
<speaker1> That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
<speaker2> Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them .

<speaker1> Lee , I'm going to get married next month .
<speaker2> Good news ! And congratulations !
<speaker1> You are invited to my wedding .
<speaker2> Thank you . I'll certainly be there .

<speaker1> Thank you for lending me the book .
<speaker2> Sure . But it's a very difficult one , you need to have a dictionary at your elbow .
<speaker1> But I'm not used to looking up every new word when I'm reading a novel . I only look up the most necessary ones .

<speaker1> Don
<speaker2> m afraid many people would turn thumbs down on it .
<speaker1> Don
<speaker2> t be so much stealing ?
<speaker1> Definitely . But I think it is too fierce .

<speaker1> The bartender just gave the last call . Let's order another round , okay ?
<speaker2> Sure , but let's get a pitcher this time We should be able to down it before they close .
<speaker1> That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place ?
<speaker2> It's all the way to the back . See that yellow door ?
<speaker1> Yeah . I think I can find it .
<speaker2> You're back already . That sure was quick .
<speaker1> That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me .
<speaker2> Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer . Anyway . He said it was too close to closing time .
<speaker1> Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway .
<speaker2> Okay , let's go !

<speaker1> hi , Mary ! What do you like to do in your spare time ?
<speaker2> well , I spend a lot of time watching movies .
<speaker1> what a confidence ! I always watch a lot of movies , too .
<speaker2> oh really , Frank ? What kind of movies do you like ?
<speaker1> actually , I watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . How about you ?
<speaker2> art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too .
<speaker1> really impressive . These two genres are totally different .
<speaker2> sure . I enjoy both of them very much .
<speaker1> how often do you go to the cinema ?
<speaker2> once in a while , I suppose , I usually rent movies at Movie Salon .
<speaker1> movie salon ? where is that ?
<speaker2> it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . I've got a membership there .
<speaker1> is it good ?
<speaker2> yes , you can find almost all new releases there .
<speaker1> really ? Maybe I shall also sign up for its membership .
<speaker2> why not ?

<speaker1> Hey Suzie . Guess what ? I'm having a baby !
<speaker2> Really ? That's so great . Congratulations .
<speaker1> Thanks . I'm so excited . We've been trying for 8 months now .
<speaker2> That's really exciting . How many months are you pregnant ?
<speaker1> Three months .
<speaker2> Are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl ?
<speaker1> I want to , but Bob doesn't . He wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way .
<speaker2> Maybe it's more exciting not knowing .
<speaker1> I'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time .
<speaker2> There are so many things you have to prepare for .
<speaker1> I know I am going to be busy , but I know I can handle it . I have been looking forward to this day for a long long time .
<speaker2> It really must be an exciting time for you guys .
<speaker1> Thank you so much .

<speaker1> Mary seems depressed . What
<speaker2> t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day

<speaker1> Believe it or not , one of the narrowest street in the world is only 49cm wide .
<speaker2> Unbelievable ! How do people go through it ?
<speaker1> That's what I'm wondering , too .
<speaker2> I wish I had a chance to see it with my own eyes .

<speaker1> Would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow ?
<speaker2> Much to my regret , I'll have to meet my girlfriend at the airport then .
<speaker1> We'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ?
<speaker2> Much as we'd like to , but we've booked up already for that time .
<speaker1> What a pity ! You can't join us .
<speaker2> So sorry . Next time we'll go , thanks anyway .

<speaker1> I'd like to invite you to dinner tonight , do you think have time ?
<speaker2> Thank you for your inition . I'm free tonight .
<speaker1> Which kind of food do you like , chinese food , western food or sea food ?
<speaker2> I prefer sea food .
<speaker1> ok . I'll pick up your hotel at 6 thirty pm .
<speaker2> That's fine . I'll be waiting for you .
<speaker1> See you later .
<speaker2> bye .

<speaker1> Look ! I bought these shoes only three weeks ago and there is a hole in them already .
<speaker2> If that happen to me , I
<speaker1> t change them .
<speaker2> That
<speaker1> t change them , I know what I would do .

<speaker1> Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ?
<speaker2> Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it .
<speaker1> Totally agree . What is your solution ?
<speaker2> Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy .
<speaker1> You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
<speaker2> It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
<speaker1> But I don

<speaker1> I am so busy today .
<speaker2> Can I help you ?
<speaker1> I
<speaker2> ll be glad to help .
<speaker1> Or maybe make the beds .
<speaker2> All you have to do is ask for help .
<speaker1> Thanks . That
<speaker2> m ready and willing to help .

<speaker1> The restaurant across the street hired a new Chinese chef , so I ordered some Chinese food there for this evening .
<speaker2> Good . I love Chinese food . What did you order ?
<speaker1> Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them .
<speaker2> Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking . I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses . Are you interested ?
<speaker1> I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves .
<speaker2> You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different .

<speaker1> You don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work .
<speaker2> I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today .
<speaker1> Do you feel ok ?
<speaker2> Not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu .
<speaker1> Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now .
<speaker2> Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ?
<speaker1> You're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down .
<speaker2> Ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting .
<speaker1> Zach , what's that on your arm ?
<speaker2> I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing .
<speaker1> It looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ?
<speaker2> Just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks .
<speaker1> I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . Let's go .
<speaker2> Shouldn't we make an appointment first ?
<speaker1> We would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse .
<speaker2> Whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting !

<speaker1> I can't go to your party .
<speaker2> That's too bad .

<speaker1> Do you like being a doctor ?
<speaker2> Yes , most of the time . But , sometimes things can get difficult .
<speaker1> Can you tell me about it ?
<speaker2> You know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . They may insist they are sick when they are not .
<speaker1> What can you do when this happens ?
<speaker2> Not much , usually I'll just keep silent .

<speaker1> Have you eaten ?
<speaker2> Not yet .

<speaker1> It's too hot to read .
<speaker2> We'd better go out for a walk .
<speaker1> Which season do you like best ?
<speaker2> Spring .
<speaker1> How about summer ?
<speaker2> I dislike it most .
<speaker1> Why ?
<speaker2> Because the hottest season is summer in a year .
<speaker1> But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .

<speaker1> My son came home from three years in the navy .
<speaker2> It was a real red letter day for you .
<speaker1> Yeah . We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .

<speaker1> John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ?
<speaker2> Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ?
<speaker1> It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day .
<speaker2> You forgot all of about it , didn't you ?

<speaker1> I must be going .
<speaker2> Okay . Keep in touch .

<speaker1> Hi , I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle . The name is Jimmy Fox .
<speaker2> I
<speaker1> t understand , I made a reservation , do you have my reservation ?
<speaker2> Yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars .
<speaker1> But the reservation keeps the car here . That
<speaker2> t think you do.If you did , I
<speaker1> t know how to hold the reservation and that
<speaker2> d like .
<speaker1> Fine . I

<speaker1> Do you think Tom will be elected president ?
<speaker2> No , I think Harry will get it .
<speaker1> Let's make a bet on who gets it .
<speaker2> OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night .

<speaker1> I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday .
<speaker2> Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer .
<speaker1> You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn
<speaker2> re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive .

<speaker1> What happened ? Why didn't he win ?
<speaker2> Didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .
<speaker1> How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
<speaker2> If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .
<speaker1> What ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
<speaker2> He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
<speaker1> I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
<speaker2> They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
<speaker1> That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
<speaker2> I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
<speaker1> Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .
<speaker2> I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
<speaker1> Let's hope so .

<speaker1> Cindy , how come nearly all the prime-time TV shows are comedies ?
<speaker2> That's because Americans love sitcoms .
<speaker1> Sitcoms ?
<speaker2> Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values .
<speaker1> In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies .
<speaker2> I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time .

<speaker1> Are you interested in history ?
<speaker2> Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks .
<speaker1> I love history , but I
<speaker2> d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again .

<speaker1> You're looking great .
<speaker2> You , too .

<speaker1> What's the matter , John ? you seemed to be restless today .
<speaker2> You see , I've been offered a new job . I can't decide whether to take it or not .
<speaker1> Oh , that's easy . If it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . That's my advice .
<speaker2> It isn't that easy . I hate to quit my present job . People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging .
<speaker1> Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ?
<speaker2> Yes , they say I would get a big sum .
<speaker1> Have you discussed it with your wife ?
<speaker2> Yes , she leaves it to me .
<speaker1> As I say it the work is well worth try . After all you can get a higher salary .
<speaker2> I have to think about it .

<speaker1> Sybil . Is that spelt with an I or a Y ?
<speaker2> Both actually . S , Y , B , I , L .
<speaker1> Of course .

<speaker1> I see Mike farmer has make it into the Olympic team . He beat the national record by 0.1 of a second .
<speaker2> That
<speaker1> s the best runner I
<speaker2> m sure he
<speaker1> re right . I think we have a very good athletics team . They should do well in the Olympics . How many medals do you think we
<speaker2> t know . I don
<speaker1> ll win many gold medals , but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones .
<speaker2> What do you think our chance are in other events .
<speaker1> In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we

<speaker1> Helen , did you hear I

<speaker1> It's said that John's broken up .
<speaker2> Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot .
<speaker1> I hear that John's leading a double wife .
<speaker2> It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife .

<speaker1> Let's play chess .
<speaker2> I haven't played chess for a long time .
<speaker1> That's all right , I'm a beginner . I've just learnt how to play .
<speaker2> Look , there's a chessboard . Those two men have already finished playing .
<speaker1> You're a very good player
<speaker2> Not really , but once I won a prize .
<speaker1> So did I . I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners .
<speaker2> My prize was for the best player in the country . Now let's start playing chess seriously .

<speaker1> You have been here for how long ? Four months now ?
<speaker2> Yeah , about .
<speaker1> Do you know Chinese better now ?
<speaker2> Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone .
<speaker1> Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere .
<speaker2> I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation .
<speaker1> A shouting match ? You
<speaker2> t believe it .
<speaker1> I am not exaggerating at all . I
<speaker2> t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it

<speaker1> Excuse me , can you tell me the name of the book you read ?
<speaker2> Harry Potter .
<speaker1> Harry Potter ? Is that book funny ?
<speaker2> Actually , the language itself is not so funny , but you can imagine the scene , that's funny .
<speaker1> Got it .
<speaker2> Have you ever read this book before ?
<speaker1> No , but my little brother likes it very much .
<speaker2> It's really a good book . You will like it too .
<speaker1> I'll try to read it . Actually , I like literature very much .
<speaker2> Wow , that sounds like a scholar . By the way , who's your favorite writer ?
<speaker1> Jane Austen .
<speaker2> Me too . Pride and Prejudice is my favorite .
<speaker1> I like it too . But Sense and Sensibility is my favorite .

<speaker1> Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren .
<speaker2> Thanks , Tim.Nice meeting you , too .
<speaker1> I guess we'll see just around .
<speaker2> Ye , I hope so.well.Take it easy .
<speaker1> You too .

<speaker1> Hey Sandra , what's wrong ? You look furious !
<speaker2> I've had it with Tim ! I think I'm going to quit !
<speaker1> But Sandra ... you love your job ! You spent months trying to get this position . It's perfect for you !
<speaker2> Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles !
<speaker1> What kind of power struggles are you talking about ?
<speaker2> Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career !
<speaker1> So he talks about you behind your back ?
<speaker2> Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back !
<speaker1> I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas .
<speaker2> I should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary I can prove it was my effort .
<speaker1> My co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . She liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday I was chatting with Tom . She meant Tom Solomon ... our CEO .

<speaker1> Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do !
<speaker2> What is it ? What happened ?
<speaker1> I think someone is stalking me .
<speaker2> No , it can't be . Really ? Who ?
<speaker1> I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .
<speaker2> What did you do ?
<speaker1> I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .
<speaker2> Did he leave when you left ?
<speaker1> Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .
<speaker2> What did you do ?

<speaker1> Man , I'm hungry . Do you know a good place to have lunch ?
<speaker2> Yes , I know a great place . What types of food do you like ?
<speaker1> Mexican , Japanese or Chinese would be great .
<speaker2> Oh , I know a place where you might like to eat .
<speaker1> Is it close by ?
<speaker2> It's down a block on the right ; can I show you the way ?
<speaker1> OK , I'd love the company .
<speaker2> This will work out well . I'm getting hungry just thinking about it .

<speaker1> have you ever been to Disneyworld ?
<speaker2> when I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ?
<speaker1> the one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland .
<speaker2> that's right . Why do you ask ?
<speaker1> well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon .
<speaker2> when are you getting married ?
<speaker1> some time next year . We haven't set the date yet .
<speaker2> congratulations ! I had no idea .
<speaker1> thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ?
<speaker2> do you like amusement parks ?
<speaker1> for the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though .
<speaker2> if you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time .
<speaker1> even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ?
<speaker2> even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun .
<speaker1> thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight .
<speaker2> I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it !

<speaker1> Matthew ? Hi !
<speaker2> Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ?
<speaker1> It's got to be almost a year now .
<speaker2> How have you been ?
<speaker1> I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it .
<speaker2> Yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ?
<speaker1> Not yet . But I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck .
<speaker2> Well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ?
<speaker1> Mrs . Thou ?
<speaker2> Yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look .
<speaker1> Great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days !
<speaker2> I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ?

<speaker1> Are you ready to go to the mall ?
<speaker2> Yeah . Dig my new pants ?
<speaker1> Copycat !
<speaker2> What do you mean ?
<speaker1> You went out and bought khakis , too !
<speaker2> No . Mine are a soft brown . Yours are khaki .
<speaker1> Whatever .

<speaker1> Have heard of Paul ?
<speaker2> No , what ?
<speaker1> He's got a promotion .
<speaker2> You're kidding .
<speaker1> No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
<speaker2> I don't believe it.He is only being with the company for two years .
<speaker1> Well , it's true.The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul .
<speaker2> Well.Good for him .

<speaker1> Jeff , I'm going to the supermarket . Do you want to come with me ?
<speaker2> I think the supermarket is closed now .
<speaker1> Oh , When does it close ?
<speaker2> It closes at 7:00 on Sundays .
<speaker1> That's too bad .
<speaker2> Don't worry , we can go tomorrow morning . It opens at 8: 00 .
<speaker1> Alright . What do you want to do now ?
<speaker2> Let's take a walk for a half an hour . My sister will get here at about 8: 30PM and then we can all go out to dinner .
<speaker1> Where does she live ?
<speaker2> She lives in San Francisco .
<speaker1> How long has she lived there ?
<speaker2> I think she's lived there for about 10 years .
<speaker1> That's a long time . Where did she live before that ?
<speaker2> San Diego .

<speaker1> Hey , Peter , have you had lunch yet ?
<speaker2> No . How about you ?
<speaker1> Not yet . Let's go to that restaurant on the corner .

<speaker1> Who's that ?
<speaker2> Search me .

<speaker1> I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he
<speaker2> t have the money yet .
<speaker1> Well , he should pay you back . It
<speaker2> t have got angry .
<speaker1> Did you lend him a lot of money ?
<speaker2> Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back .
<speaker1> Well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It
<speaker2> t . I guess you
<speaker1> t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ?

<speaker1> Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy .
<speaker2> I don
<speaker1> t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres .

<speaker1> Do you know that the dolphin is the most intelligent animal in the world ?
<speaker2> Yes . Dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart . They are also the fastest swimmers in the world .
<speaker1> They must be amazing animals .
<speaker2> They are . I read a story about a dolphin saving a A from drowning in the sea .
<speaker1> I read that story too . They seem to be able to understand men .
<speaker2> They sure can . Maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes .

<speaker1> Oh dear , my weight has gone up again .
<speaker2> I am not surprised , you eat too much .
<speaker1> And I suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help .
<speaker2> No , I wouldn't think so .
<speaker1> I do wish I could lose weight .
<speaker2> Well , why don't you go on the diet ?
<speaker1> I've tried diets before but they've never worked .
<speaker2> Perhaps you should excercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class .
<speaker1> Yes , maybe I should .

<speaker1> Could you please wait for a minute ? I'll buy the tickets
<speaker2> All right .
<speaker1> Here is your ticket .
<speaker2> Thank you .
<speaker1> The park will close soon . We Should better go in right now .
<speaker2> Really ?
<speaker1> Yes , let's go in .
<speaker2> It is a new park , isn't it ?
<speaker1> Yes , how do you know ?
<speaker2> I guessed it .
<speaker1> Well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well .
<speaker2> Oh , how wonderful !

<speaker1> I was just watching a documentary on TV about how people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting .
<speaker2> I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers .
<speaker1> The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow .
<speaker2> Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation .
<speaker1> Don
<speaker2> t ride regularly though . How about you ?
<speaker1> I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ?
<speaker2> What a good idea !

<speaker1> Where's Mrs . Johnson ?
<speaker2> Just call her Lisa , Mary . She's cooking dinner .
<speaker1> I see . Can I sit down ?
<speaker2> Of course ! Make yourself at home .
<speaker1> Thank you , Mr . Johnson .
<speaker2> Please , just call me Tom .
<speaker1> Okay , Tom .
<speaker2> Where's Cindy ?
<speaker1> She's upstairs in my room .
<speaker2> Can you tell her to come downstairs ? We're about to have dinner .

<speaker1> Have you heard of Paul ?
<speaker2> No , what ?
<speaker1> He's got a promotion .
<speaker2> You're kidding .
<speaker1> No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
<speaker2> Oh , I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years .
<speaker1> Well , it's true . The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul .
<speaker2> Well . Good for him .

<speaker1> Let's speed up . We're going to be late again .
<speaker2> If we hurry , can we get there in time ?
<speaker1> I hope so .

<speaker1> Is it your first time to join the sports meeting of Junior High School ?
<speaker2> Yes , and it's great . What are the events at the sports meeting ?
<speaker1> Long-distance race , dash , hurdle race , relay race , standing long jump , high jump , shotput and so on .
<speaker2> Our neighbor , Bruce , will take part in the relay race . Let's go have a look .
<speaker1> OK , let's go .
<speaker2> The competition will begin in 5 minutes , it's tense here .
<speaker1> Wonderful , Bruce is taking the lead .
<speaker2> Other competitors have almost caught up with him . They are neck and neck .
<speaker1> Come on , Bruce . Come on , Bruce .
<speaker2> Wow , Bruce crossed the line first .

<speaker1> Tim

<speaker1> Have you enjoyed your weekend ?
<speaker2> Yes , it's been marvelous . It really was very kind of you to invite me . I hope it hasn't been too much trouble .
<speaker1> Not at all . We've really enjoyed having you . I hope you'll come and stay again next time you're in Changsha .

<speaker1> The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors .
<speaker2> It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it .
<speaker1> Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon .
<speaker2> That's true .

<speaker1> I
<speaker2> Ve told you a thousand times that I
<speaker1> t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ?
<speaker2> Yes , I
<speaker1> t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ?

<speaker1> What would you like for Christmas ?
<speaker2> I would like to have that new style Gl Joe .
<speaker1> Have you asked Santa ?
<speaker2> Yes and I've written him a letter .

<speaker1> Lili , let
<speaker2> t have much money left after paying the rent .
<speaker1> Well , Lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van 10 . We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . Trust me , it won
<speaker2> s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won
<speaker1> t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven
<speaker2> re right . When do you plan to go ?
<speaker1> The sooner the better ! I can
<speaker2> t know where we
<speaker1> re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time .
<speaker2> Let

<speaker1> What date will our field trip be on ?
<speaker2> The science field trip is next Monday at 8 o'clock in the morning . Do you want to make note of that on your calendar ?
<speaker1> Yes , I will make note of that .
<speaker2> Next Monday is December 2nd . The buses will leave at 8 , but we must begin loading at 7
<speaker1> I will be there half an hour early .
<speaker2> You might want to tell whoever is picking you up that you will return on December 8th . Do you have a ride ?
<speaker1> Yes , someone is picking me up .
<speaker2> To get back to campus by 8
<speaker1> Not at the moment — maybe later , though .
<speaker2> All of the extra information that you need is on the bulletin board in the hallway . See you on Monday !

<speaker1> The acting of this film is marvelous in spite of the thin plot .
<speaker2> I'm sorry for hero .
<speaker1> I don't think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts .
<speaker2> Don't be too critical . We can't expect it to be perfect .

<speaker1> How was your business trip ?
<speaker2> Great - they wined and dined us all week .

<speaker1> Nice to meet you here.How come you dropped into this company today ?
<speaker2> My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office . I didn't know you were working here.What a surprise.How long have you been doing this ?
<speaker1> Two years or so .
<speaker2> That is great.Do you have to work the night shift ?
<speaker1> No , in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . I work five days a week .
<speaker2> Do you enjoy work here ?
<speaker1> It is hard to say.But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant.Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy .
<speaker2> Take it easy . I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job .
<speaker1> Luckily not.The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss .
<speaker2> Glad to hear that .

<speaker1> Scientists have found a second solar system in the universe .
<speaker2> What's the second solar system ?
<speaker1> It's just a system like ours , with a star and a number of planets going around it .
<speaker2> Is this good news or bad news ?
<speaker1> It's exciting news ! If we find a second solar system , we might find a second earth !
<speaker2> You mean with people on it ?
<speaker1> Yes ! Isn't that exciting ?

<speaker1> Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?
<speaker2> Sorry , I thought you knew .
<speaker1> But you should tell me you were in love with her .
<speaker2> Didn't I ?
<speaker1> You know you didn't .
<speaker2> Well , I am telling you now .
<speaker1> Yes , but you might have told me before .
<speaker2> I didn't think you would be interested .
<speaker1> You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?
<speaker2> Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .
<speaker1> Oh , you men ! You are all the same .

<speaker1> How was the movie last night ?
<speaker2> I didn't really like it .
<speaker1> Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .
<speaker2> I found it very disappointing .
<speaker1> She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see .
<speaker2> I wasn't happy with it .
<speaker1> Nothing is to your satisfaction .

<speaker1> Honey , I
<speaker2> m going to get my nails done .
<speaker1> Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ?
<speaker2> Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me !
<speaker1> Why ? I don
<speaker2> t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
<speaker1> Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do .

<speaker1> Good afternoon !
<speaker2> Good afternoon ! Sit down , please.How are you ?
<speaker1> I'm very well , thank you.How are you ?
<speaker2> Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ?
<speaker1> Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot .
<speaker2> Yes .
<speaker1> What's the weather like in your country ?
<speaker2> Mm ... It's quite warm now .
<speaker1> Where do you live ?
<speaker2> In London.Where do you live ?
<speaker1> Here.Near this school .

<speaker1> I
<speaker2> m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere !
<speaker1> So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ?
<speaker2> That
<speaker1> Ve decided to create my own company ! I
<speaker2> t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that
<speaker1> t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc .
<speaker2> Well , that seems easy enough .
<speaker1> Wait , there
<speaker2> ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea .
<speaker1> Geez . Is that all ?
<speaker2> Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
<speaker1> Umm . I think I

<speaker1> I hear that Mary got mad .
<speaker2> So I heard .
<speaker1> What

<speaker1> Um , what will you do this weekend ?
<speaker2> How about a movie ? We haven't done that for a while .
<speaker1> A movie ? Sure . Do you know what's on right now ?
<speaker2> No . Why don't you check out the newspaper ?
<speaker1> Ok . Maybe you should invite your sister along , too .

<speaker1> What
<speaker2> s such a girl
<speaker1> s not . It
<speaker2> re a girl .
<speaker1> Well , you just want to watch Dark Angel because of the hot girl .
<speaker2> That
<speaker1> s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits .
<speaker2> O . K . , O . K . Let
<speaker1> s a football game on too .
<speaker2> No way . I
<speaker1> s to watch the game .

<speaker1> It
<speaker2> t you see many parents are forcing there children
<speaker1> t know how to educate their children .

<speaker1> Sarah , what did you do today ?
<speaker2> I went shopping .
<speaker1> Did you buy anything ?
<speaker2> Yes , I bought a few things .
<speaker1> What did you buy ?
<speaker2> I bought this coat . Do you like it ?
<speaker1> Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ?
<speaker2> At the mall on 5th street .
<speaker1> Was it expensive ?
<speaker2> No , it wasn't expensive . It was on sale for 20 dollars .
<speaker1> That's cheap .
<speaker2> I know . It was a really good deal .
<speaker1> I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . It's been really hot lately .

<speaker1> Hi , Victor . How are you ?
<speaker2> Oh , I'm fine .
<speaker1> So , are you going to go to class tonight ?
<speaker2> Maybe ... but I don't think so .
<speaker1> Really ? What's the matter ?
<speaker2> I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad .
<speaker1> Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner .
<speaker2> Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already .

<speaker1> How's John doing ?
<speaker2> He can barely make ends meet .

<speaker1> The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 .
<speaker2> They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
<speaker1> If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final .
<speaker2> No way , if it still has 21 .

<speaker1> What's that book you have under your arm ?
<speaker2> It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months .
<speaker1> How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn .
<speaker2> I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day .
<speaker1> Is it really worth paying for ?
<speaker2> I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter .
<speaker1> If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .

<speaker1> Come on , you are left behind !
<speaker2> Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey .
<speaker1> You just need more exercise .
<speaker2> Yes , but you need to slow down . This is jogging , not racing !
<speaker1> I don't care . I want to burn up my fat .
<speaker2> But running so fast is not good for people over forties .
<speaker1> Why ?
<speaker2> We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us .
<speaker1> But I want to burn up more calories !
<speaker2> In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time .
<speaker1> Really ? I will slow down then .

<speaker1> Hello , Daisy , how are you doing ?
<speaker2> Fine , thank you . I haven
<speaker1> " I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn
<speaker2> ve been obsessed with horror films . "
 " Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They
<speaker1> ' Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them . '
<speaker2> s amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn
<speaker1> s really exciting . "
 " Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn
<speaker2> ll watch any type of movie except horror . "
<speaker1> " I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you
<speaker2> Maybe . After all , I am grown up now .

<speaker1> It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession .
<speaker2> The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports .
<speaker1> Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost .
<speaker2> It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy .

<speaker1> Are you an art aficionado ?
<speaker2> Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren
<speaker1> t pay much attention in art class at school .
<speaker2> Art isn
<speaker1> m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It
<speaker2> d love to go with you .
<speaker1> I thought I
<speaker2> s meet at 12 thirty . it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits .

<speaker1> What does your mother do , may I ask ?
<speaker2> My mother works in a company as an accountant .
<speaker1> Is she busy ?
<speaker2> Not always , she's rather busy at the end of the year .

<speaker1> Hello , Bessie .
<speaker2> Hello , Jack.Happy birthday !
<speaker1> My birthday ? I forgot it , Thank you for remembering my birthday .
<speaker2> I'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . I've asked the Fairy Flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . I hope you'll like them .
<speaker1> Thanks a lot . I'm so touched .
<speaker2> Now let me sing " Happy birthday " for you .
<speaker1> Thank you very much .

<speaker1> Nice day , isn't it ?
<speaker2> It sure is .
<speaker1> It's a good day for a picnic .

<speaker1> Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ?
<speaker2> I don't want to .
<speaker1> Well , come over and talk to me then .
<speaker2> Certainly not .
<speaker1> May I turn on the TV then ?
<speaker2> Turn on the TV for what ?
<speaker1> So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
<speaker2> Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ?
<speaker1> I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner .
<speaker2> To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it .

<speaker1> Diane Grant ? I haven't seen you for ages !
<speaker2> Brian ! How have you been ?
<speaker1> Pretty good . Say , you've really changed !
<speaker2> Oh , well , I've lost some weight . And my hair is longer than before .
<speaker1> Well , you look great ! How are you ?
<speaker2> I'm doing really well . I got married about three years ago . I have two kids now .
<speaker1> That's terrific !

<speaker1> How is your new dormitory ?
<speaker2> It's very nice . There are only four people , and those girls are very kind and friendly .
<speaker1> Well , do you all major in the same subject ?
<speaker2> No , the other three girls major in a computer science , and they can help me a lot with the computer operating .
<speaker1> That's great !

<speaker1> Peter , how often do you exercise ?
<speaker2> Well , I swim and run every day .
<speaker1> Now , tell me , what do you eat ?
<speaker2> Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .
<speaker1> Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
<speaker2> Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
<speaker1> What do you drink ?
<speaker2> Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .

<speaker1> What
<speaker2> m sorry I missed it .
<speaker1> Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb .
<speaker2> Yeah , I will . See you then !
<speaker1> O . K . See you .

<speaker1> How many languages can you speak ?
<speaker2> I can speak French and German .
<speaker1> How well can you speak them ?
<speaker2> I can speak German quite well , but I can't speak French very well .
<speaker1> Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now ?
<speaker2> No , but I'll be able to tomorrow .

<speaker1> Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ?
<speaker2> Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes .
<speaker1> It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture .
<speaker2> You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler .
<speaker1> Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball !
<speaker2> It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards .

<speaker1> Do you really have to work today ?
<speaker2> Yes . I'm afraid so .
<speaker1> But you'll miss out on the football game .
<speaker2> Oh . Well , it can't be helped .

<speaker1> How smart of you to book the tickets before hand !
<speaker2> Oh , do you really think so ?
<speaker1> Of course , otherwise you

<speaker1> I had an accident .
<speaker2> That's terrible !

<speaker1> I found a new job after all , and I like this one even better than the last .
<speaker2> You see ? Every cloud has a silver lining .

<speaker1> Tom , I won first prize in the poetry contest .
<speaker2> Come on ! You're pulling my leg .
<speaker1> Really ! Here's my trophy .
<speaker2> Wow ! Congratulations !

<speaker1> What a beautiful watch . It goes very well with your ring .
<speaker2> Thank you .
<speaker1> Is that your wedding ring ?
<speaker2> I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring .
<speaker1> Well , congratulations . When is the big date ?
<speaker2> In June .
<speaker1> Did you have the watch before getting the ring ?
<speaker2> Actually , we bought the ring together after I got the watch .
<speaker1> You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous .
<speaker2> Thank you so much .
<speaker1> What kind of watch is it ?
<speaker2> It's a Tag Heer .
<speaker1> If you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ?
<speaker2> This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 .
<speaker1> That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for .
<speaker2> Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones .

<speaker1> I'm really mad at Bob .
<speaker2> What for ? ( Why ? )

<speaker1> Hi , Jack , how have you been ?
<speaker2> Not very well .
<speaker1> Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ?
<speaker2> Nothing .
<speaker1> Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter .
<speaker2> Well , you're right . I just broke up with Jane .
<speaker1> Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher .
<speaker2> Well , you never know . I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young .
<speaker1> Well , she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family .
<speaker2> Maybe you're right .
<speaker1> Jack , I don't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate , your perfect match !
<speaker2> Yeah , but it's hard to forget her at moment . You know , we were together for almost five years . It's really hard ...

<speaker1> Do you know Sally ?
<speaker2> Sally . She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains .
<speaker1> Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop clock .
<speaker2> Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career .

<speaker1> Excuse me . Do you have the time ?
<speaker2> My watch is a few minutes fast . It's about six forty , I think .
<speaker1> Is it ? Oh , no . The concert will begin in twenty minutes . Are we too late to get there ?
<speaker2> If we start now , we can make it by taxi .

<speaker1> Did you watch the volleyball match last night ?
<speaker2> Yeah .
<speaker1> Who won ?
<speaker2> China .
<speaker1> What is the score ?
<speaker2> China beat Brazil three to zero .
<speaker1> Wonderful .

<speaker1> What do you mean ? If he was a good programmer , he should have been raking it in .
<speaker2> The boss wanted to pay Bob with stock options . But Bob didn't want to play that game again .
<speaker1> Again ?
<speaker2> At his last start-up , Bob worked for stock and no salary . They folded and he made zip .
<speaker1> Ouch .
<speaker2> Now he only works freelance . Hundred bucks an hour .

<speaker1> You mustn't touch the wet paint , Bill .
<speaker2> I'm sorry . I won't do it again .
<speaker1> Try to be more careful in future . Look ! you've damaged the sign .
<speaker2> Is this the sign ? What does it says ?
<speaker1> It says No smoking here .

<speaker1> Good morning . I
<speaker2> Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story .
<speaker1> That
<speaker2> s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case .
<speaker1> How do you research your books ?
<speaker2> I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people .
<speaker1> I really like your books . I
<speaker2> s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven
<speaker1> ll make sure you get an advance copy to review .
<speaker2> Thanks very much . I
<speaker1> t wait to read it . Here

<speaker1> What shall I call him ?
<speaker2> Oh , you may call him Uncle , or Henry .
<speaker1> What's he doing ?
<speaker2> He's checking bags.He ' s an official in the customs .

<speaker1> For the 100th anniversary of the opening of the library we are going to have a party .
<speaker2> That's a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library !
<speaker1> I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas .
<speaker2> That is right up my alley . You say party and I'm there .
<speaker1> Perfect . It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people .
<speaker2> Will it be an all day event ?
<speaker1> Yes . And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library .
<speaker2> That was quick thinking .

<speaker1> I'm so glad I bought this watch !
<speaker2> Cool ! Flashy red lines !
<speaker1> I think this is the coolest watch I've ever owned .
<speaker2> Is it waterproof ?
<speaker1> Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am .
<speaker2> Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ?
<speaker1> Well , surfing , scuba diving ...

<speaker1> Do you take a bus to and from work ?
<speaker2> Yeah , everyday . And there
<speaker1> s always rush hour . So the buses are always crowded .
<speaker2> Oh , yeah , it
<speaker1> s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt .
<speaker2> That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus .
<speaker1> What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ?
<speaker2> You just can
<speaker1> s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl
<speaker2> t you ?
<speaker1> What do you think ? I

<speaker1> We are going to have a picnic tomorrow at the picnic center .
<speaker2> That's great .
<speaker1> Now let's get things ready .
<speaker2> Don't worry . There are all kinds of things in the center .
<speaker1> That's much more convenient . We don't even have to bring the flavorings .

<speaker1> Look ! Mom , that's amazing ! I can't believe the girls have so neat movements .
<speaker2> Yeah , they all received very strict training . A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice .
<speaker1> And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water .
<speaker2> Exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together .
<speaker1> There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming .
<speaker2> That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games .
<speaker1> Wow , Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad . I must learn from you .
<speaker2> My little boy , you should learn more from me . I'm almost thirty years older than you .
<speaker1> OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool .
<speaker2> Oh , my God . It's so dangerous . And he might break his leg . You mustn't do anything like that .

<speaker1> It seems that nobody in your class likes Paul .
<speaker2> The boy is good for nothing .
<speaker1> As a teacher , I don

<speaker1> Hey Rachael , what's up ? How is your day ?
<speaker2> Not bad.We have had a big meeting today , remember ?
<speaker1> Oh , yea . I forgot.So how did it go ?
<speaker2> Pretty well . I think the boss liked my ideas .
<speaker1> Great , so what happens now ?
<speaker2> Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it .

<speaker1> Do you believe in UFOs ?
<speaker2> Of course , they are out there .
<speaker1> But I never saw them .
<speaker2> Are you stupid ? They are called UFOs , so not everybody can see them .
<speaker1> You mean that you can them .
<speaker2> That's right . I can see them in my dreams .
<speaker1> They come to the earth ?
<speaker2> No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space .
<speaker1> Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ?
<speaker2> OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings .
<speaker1> That means that you talk to them ? In which language ?
<speaker2> Of course in English , they learn English on Mars too .
<speaker1> Wow . Sounds fantastic !

<speaker1> You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ?
<speaker2> Yes . I
<speaker1> s not my birthday today . Well , you
<speaker2> t you ?
<speaker1> Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me .
<speaker2> My pleasure .

<speaker1> Do you have a minute ?
<speaker2> Sure . What's up ?

<speaker1> Hey , May , look , Is that the the poster of the movie we saw yesterday ?
<speaker2> Yes , that's right . That's the poster of the The Witch .
<speaker1> May , I really regret watching it with you last night .
<speaker2> Did it scare you ?
<speaker1> Of course not . I just thought the movie was ... boring .
<speaker2> Boring ? Come on , you clutched to my arm all the time .
<speaker1> Well , I admit . The ghosts were scary .
<speaker2> I like scary movies .
<speaker1> That's Gucci's influence . I love science fiction movies !
<speaker2> Of course you do . They are silly stories just for little kids like you .
<speaker1> Don't call me kid . I am a grownup .
<speaker2> Do you dare watch scary movies with me tonight ?
<speaker1> Of course ! I can watch them without you !
<speaker2> Oh , really ?

<speaker1> What is your nationality ?
<speaker2> I am Chinese by birth .
<speaker1> Where is your domicile place ?
<speaker2> My domicile place is Hebes Province .

<speaker1> I know you have a son . How old is he ?
<speaker2> He's going to turn six next month .
<speaker1> Who is looking after him ?
<speaker2> My mother-in - law . She retired last year .
<speaker1> You really are lucky !
<speaker2> Yeah , I know .

<speaker1> Say , what's your favorite sport ?
<speaker2> Mmmm ... it's hard to say . I like golf a lot-but I guess I like tennis better .
<speaker1> Do you play much tennis ?
<speaker2> Yes , quite a bit . How about a game sometime ?
<speaker1> Sorry . I'm strictly a spectator-football , baseball , basketball , golf ... I watch them all .

<speaker1> So Janet , do you do any sports ?
<speaker2> Well , I go to the gym a lot . I am a member of a gym nearby .
<speaker1> Yeah , how often do you go ?
<speaker2> About three times a week if I can .
<speaker1> Not bad ! Do you do any other sports ?
<speaker2> Not really . I

<speaker1> Have you just been to the cinema ?
<speaker2> Yes , I have .
<speaker1> What
<speaker2> Ve already seen it . I saw it on television last year . It
<speaker1> s very good .
<speaker2> Paris is a beautiful city . I have never been there . Have you ever been there , Ken ?
<speaker1> Yes , I have . I was there in April .
<speaker2> Paris in the spring , eh ?
<speaker1> It was spring , but the weather was awful . It rained all the time .
<speaker2> Just like dear old London !

<speaker1> They got a divorce at last .
<speaker2> It's inevitable . Their love wasbuilt on the sand , and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks .
<speaker1> You said it . Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks .
<speaker2> That give us a good lesson .

<speaker1> Where are you going ?
<speaker2> I'll accompany my wife to the hospital .
<speaker1> What's wrong with her .
<speaker2> She is expecting .
<speaker1> Congratulations to you .
<speaker2> Thank you .

<speaker1> I can ' t stand being with you anymore . I'm sick of your drinking .
<speaker2> I swear never to drink again . Just give me another chance , please !
<speaker1> How many chances have I given you ? I don
<speaker2> " You know how hard I
<speaker1> d be lost without you . I won

<speaker1> Are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ?
<speaker2> There are a few stories about natural disasters . There is a massive forest fire in Australia . It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers .
<speaker1> Was it caused accidentally or naturally ? Sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in Australia and Africa .
<speaker2> Nobody knows at the moment , but it has been very hot there recently . The drought in Africa is causing starvation . Millions of people have migrated to try and find food .
<speaker1> What is the international community doing to help ?
<speaker2> The European union has sent several plants with relief supplies . Several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies . Refugee camps have been set up across the region .
<speaker1> How many countries have been affected ?
<speaker2> Six have been seriously affected , but the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries .
<speaker1> I saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in iran .
<speaker2> Yes . There have been a few there recently . They say that this one was not a big quake . The Iranians are dealing with it on their own . They have purchased some special equipment to find people buried u
<speaker1> Does the newspaper say anything about casualties ?
<speaker2> So far , less than 20 people have died , but over 100 are in hospital .

<speaker1> Is this a photo of your family ?
<speaker2> Yes , it is.It was taken just before I was leaving for college .
<speaker1> You look so lovely .
<speaker2> How time flies ! I'll not see twenty again .

<speaker1> I heard you've found a new job .
<speaker2> Yes , I'm now working in a company .
<speaker1> So you're quite happy with your new job ?
<speaker2> Right . I enjoy what I'm doing .

<speaker1> Would you come to spend the weekend with us ?
<speaker2> Oh , I
<speaker1> t . I
<speaker2> s too bad .
<speaker1> May be some other time .

<speaker1> You received a letter in the mail .
<speaker2> Give it here .
<speaker1> Who
<speaker2> s my acceptance letter from NYU .
<speaker1> I want to know what it says .
<speaker2> They didn
<speaker1> s the truth .
<speaker2> Are you okay ?
<speaker1> I really wanted to get into NYU .
<speaker2> I am really sorry to hear that .
<speaker1> It
<speaker2> m still waiting to hear from UCLA anyway .

<speaker1> Why are you so quiet ?
<speaker2> My girlfriend just broke up with me .
<speaker1> You must feel terrible now .
<speaker2> Yeah .
<speaker1> I remember my first break up . It was the worst feeling in the world . I was crying everyday for three months . And slowly , it got better . I know you'll feel better too .
<speaker2> You've been through this too ?
<speaker1> Yeah . I remember it very clearly . The pain makes it easy to remember . I know you're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups .
<speaker2> But it hurts too much .
<speaker1> I know it's painful , but it's only temporary . After the pain goes away , you'll find other girls .
<speaker2> What if I don't want to find another girl ?
<speaker1> You'll change your mind . Look at everyone in the world . They all break up and move on . The faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover .
<speaker2> You're right .
<speaker1> I also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . You know she didn't treat you that well . Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
<speaker2> Yeah . Thanks for the talk .
<speaker1> I'll give you a call later . We should hang out . It's good to be around people .
<speaker2> Ok . I'll talk to you later .

<speaker1> Excuse me , what do you want for this bag ?
<speaker2> Let me see . The one goes for $ 17 .
<speaker1> Would you take $ 12 ?
<speaker2> No , I can

<speaker1> I
<speaker2> m terribly sorry , Won
<speaker1> t hear of it .

<speaker1> A :: Mr Clinton , it's nice to see you again .
<speaker2> Nice to see you again , too . Peter . How's your family ?
<speaker1> A :: Very well . How's Mrs Clinton ?
<speaker2> Not bad , But she's as busy as before .

<speaker1> Whatever we do , we should do it above board .
<speaker2> You are right . We shouldn't do anything under the table .
<speaker1> Well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about through other channels .

<speaker1> Morning , Zina . Just wanted to say thanks again !
<speaker2> Hi , Vince . Thanks for stopping by . How's the work coming along for the online auction ?
<speaker1> Oh , yeah . I'm glad you mentioned that . I think we need to hire somebody new to manage it .
<speaker2> Can't Elvin handle it ?
<speaker1> I think he's got too much on his plate .

<speaker1> This is the best dinner I've ever had .
<speaker2> How about the soup ?
<speaker1> I've never tasted anything better .
<speaker2> How nice of you to say so .

<speaker1> Hey Nick , what are you up to ?
<speaker2> Not much , just heading over to the shooting range . You wanna come ?
<speaker1> Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don
<speaker2> s really fun too ! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim .
<speaker1> Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower !
<speaker2> Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don
<speaker1> t inspected yourself . Always make sure there isn
<speaker2> t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
<speaker1> The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ?
<speaker2> Let

<speaker1> Hi , Jim . How are you ? I haven
<speaker2> m fine . I

<speaker1> Broadway Mall is having a big sale this weekend . You wanna go ?
<speaker2> Don't feel like it . I'm broke .
<speaker1> Well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ?
<speaker2> Just look around ? Ah , that's boring .
<speaker1> I'll go myself then .

<speaker1> What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps .
<speaker2> I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated .
<speaker1> come on , nothing can be that bad .
<speaker2> but promise me , you'll keep it a secret .
<speaker1> ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ?
<speaker2> I've fallen in love with my boss .
<speaker1> really ? Is he married ?
<speaker2> no , of course not . He is still single .
<speaker1> then what's your problem ?
<speaker2> I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us .
<speaker1> oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip .
<speaker2> worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days .
<speaker1> office romance is very tricky .
<speaker2> it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed .
<speaker1> cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine .

<speaker1> You're not looking happy . What's the matter ?
<speaker2> Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired .
<speaker1> With the job ?
<speaker2> With everything , with everybody , with all this !
<speaker1> A good suggestion for you . You need a holiday .
<speaker2> It wasn't always like this , you know .
<speaker1> What do you mean ?
<speaker2> Well , I mean . We always do the same thing . There's no variety in our lives .
<speaker1> You need a holiday . That's what's the matter .
<speaker2> Certainly , perhaps .

<speaker1> I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there is .
<speaker2> Hey , Isabelle ...
<speaker1> Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true .
<speaker2> Yes , I am the guy .
<speaker1> What a bummer ! You set me up ?
<speaker2> Let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ...
<speaker1> How dare you ! ( starts to walk off )
<speaker2> Hang on one second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella !
<speaker1> Why did you lie to me in the email ?
<speaker2> I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name .
<speaker1> I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me .
<speaker2> I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over .

<speaker1> Peter , how often do you exercise ?
<speaker2> Well , I swim and run every day .
<speaker1> Now , tell me , what do you eat ?
<speaker2> Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .
<speaker1> Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
<speaker2> Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
<speaker1> What do you drink ?
<speaker2> Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .
<speaker1> What do you drink ?

<speaker1> Did you watch the volleyball match last night ?
<speaker2> Yeah .
<speaker1> Who won ?
<speaker2> China .
<speaker1> What was the score ?
<speaker2> China beat Brazil 3 to 0 .
<speaker1> Wonderful !

<speaker1> Even if our company didn't have a dress code , I still think people would wear formal clothing to work .
<speaker2> I wouldn't be so sure ... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in .
<speaker1> Maybe that's true for some positions , but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . They dress for success ! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . It's just not respectful to you client .
<speaker2> I think what you wear is so overrated . I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman .
<speaker1> It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale .
<speaker2> Maybe you're right , but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day !

<speaker1> Isn't it wonderful walking here ?
<speaker2> What do you mean ?
<speaker1> I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
<speaker2> Yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall .
<speaker1> It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ?
<speaker2> You're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering .
<speaker1> What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ?
<speaker2> Quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark in the history of architecture .
<speaker1> What's there after that ?
<speaker2> Well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world .
<speaker1> What are they all for ?
<speaker2> Most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the world . And there are lots of very expensive places .

<speaker1> Hey Kevin , what are you doing here ? Don't you usually spend Tuesday nights at home studying ?
<speaker2> I needed to get out of the house . My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them .
<speaker1> What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ?
<speaker2> Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend .
<speaker1> And your parents took it badly ?
<speaker2> That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her .
<speaker1> Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ?
<speaker2> She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . My dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away .
<speaker1> How long has your sister been with her boyfriend ?
<speaker2> Three years . They've been dating since freshman year . They're even talking about marriage .
<speaker1> Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea .
<speaker2> What do you mean ?
<speaker1> Well , these days too many people are getting divorced . If they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not .
<speaker2> I guess so . Better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out .

<speaker1> Do you think they two will get married ?
<speaker2> Yeah , you can count on it .
<speaker1> I think so . Yes , they get along so well .
<speaker2> I like him . He's good for her .
<speaker1> You're right . He sure is .

<speaker1> What do you think of Frank ?
<speaker2> He is all right . But I think he seems to have no back bone .
<speaker1> Why do you say that ?
<speaker2> Whatever things get tough , he gives in .

<speaker1> Uh-oh . We don't have a flashlight .
<speaker2> Don't worry . We'll make it back to the camp site before dark .
<speaker1> I sure hope so .

<speaker1> Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ?
<speaker2> Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English .
<speaker1> I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ?
<speaker2> Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said .
<speaker1> It must be interesting to study English .
<speaker2> Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss.Parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
<speaker1> Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ?
<speaker2> Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them .

<speaker1> It's quiet everywhere in winter .
<speaker2> Yes . I like winter .
<speaker1> Me too .
<speaker2> It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ?
<speaker1> That's a good idea . Let's go !
<speaker2> What a heavy snow ! Look ! The water is frozen .
<speaker1> Take care ! Don't slip on the ground .
<speaker2> I've got it . I like the feeling of stepping on the ice .
<speaker1> Yes . Very wonderful .
<speaker2> There is a snowman over there .
<speaker1> How lovely it is !

<speaker1> Tim's always bothering me .
<speaker2> Just tell him off .

<speaker1> Who are those guys ?
<speaker2> Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O
<speaker1> star players .
<speaker2> Oh .
<speaker1> Wait a second . He shoots , he scores !
<speaker2> All right !
<speaker1> Here comes Jordan , though .
<speaker2> Wow , Michael Jordan
<speaker1> s older , so he doesn
<speaker2> s still amazing .
<speaker1> Which team do you think will win ?
<speaker2> The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has .

<speaker1> I am sorry to trouble you again , Mr.Stone .
<speaker2> It's ok . What do you want to ask ?
<speaker1> Where should I go after I arrived at the university ?
<speaker2> The first place you should go is the International Center .
<speaker1> Why ?
<speaker2> You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers .
<speaker1> What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ?
<speaker2> They'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you .
<speaker1> Can we get any more help at the International Center ?
<speaker2> Yes , a lot more . If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student ID and social security number there . They will keep your documents up-to-date . They will offer an orientation program for new comers . They will also help you contact your department and registration office .
<speaker1> I see . It must be worth going to .
<speaker2> Besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . In cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the International Center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year .
<speaker1> Wonderful . It is a home for foreign students .
<speaker2> It sure is . They also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . The Center staff members are also friendly and helpful . Everyone loves them .

<speaker1> hi , Lander . What's wrong ?
<speaker2> I can hardly make ends meet these days .
<speaker1> same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months .
<speaker2> my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .
<speaker1> true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .
<speaker2> definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .
<speaker1> the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken .
<speaker2> is that inflation ?
<speaker1> inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation .
<speaker2> has the government taken some measures to curb it ?
<speaker1> yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .
<speaker2> but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .
<speaker1> you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending .
<speaker2> how ?
<speaker1> for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense .
<speaker2> sounds a good idea .

<speaker1> OK , everyone . Gather around . Here are the rules . No tackling . No pushing .
<speaker2> You shouldn't grab someone else's shirt . That's a foul .
<speaker1> Play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched .
<speaker2> You can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees .
<speaker1> The touchdown lines are there and there . OK , let's play !
<speaker2> Before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men .

<speaker1> Have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ?
<speaker2> Yeah , almost . But there is one thing .
<speaker1> What ?
<speaker2> I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ...
<speaker1> What is it ?
<speaker2> Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others .
<speaker1> That makes you feel uncomfortable ?
<speaker2> Yeah . we never do that in a public office .
<speaker1> Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy .
<speaker2> I have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding .
<speaker1> Well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus .
<speaker2> Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ?
<speaker1> Yeah .
<speaker2> Oh , I'm shocked .

<speaker1> What courses did you take in college ?
<speaker2> I took a lot of courses , such as Philosophy , Logic , Ethics , Aesthetics , etc .
<speaker1> Which course did you like best ?
<speaker2> I liked Aesthetics best . It is very impressive .

<speaker1> Hi . Have you got a personal computer ?
<speaker2> Certainly . What's the matter ?
<speaker1> I wonder if you often trade with others on the internet .
<speaker2> Sure . I often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores .
<speaker1> Great ! It's just like viewless stores . But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ?
<speaker2> That's simple . Just click the hyperlink , www.taobao.com or www . ebay.com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . And the goods will be delivered to your place .
<speaker1> Is the service charged ?
<speaker2> No . it's free .
<speaker1> Really . I'll get a computer at once .

<speaker1> We are planning to go to Beidaihe for vacation . Do you want to go with us ?
<speaker2> It

<speaker1> Excuse me , is this seat taken ?
<speaker2> I
<speaker1> re welcome . Why don

<speaker1> I prefer potatoes to eggplants .
<speaker2> I feel eggplants are more nutritious .
<speaker1> But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better .
<speaker2> Oh , that's how you see it .

<speaker1> Are you sure you can't lend me five thousand dollars ?
<speaker2> Hmm ... I'll tell you what . I'll lend you four thousand dollars , but you have to pay me back next week .
<speaker1> It's a deal .

<speaker1> Where do you plan to go this winter ?
<speaker2> Alps , suppose .
<speaker1> Oh , yes , you like skiing .
<speaker2> Right .

<speaker1> Every time when heroes came back from the battlefield , we took our hats off to them .
<speaker2> You were showing respect and admiration for them .
<speaker1> I wish I were a hero .

<speaker1> Frank

<speaker1> OK . Come back into the classroom , class .
<speaker2> Does the class start again , Mam ?
<speaker1> Yes , but to the heath , this break has long enough .
<speaker2> Oh , breaktime flies .
<speaker1> Come on , baby . It

<speaker1> Do you have any hobbies ?
<speaker2> Yes , I like collecting things .
<speaker1> Oh , that
<speaker2> t just imagine it .

<speaker1> Jenny , what's wrong with you ? Why do you keep weeping like that ?
<speaker2> Mary told me that she had seen you with John last night . I got to know the fact that you are playing the field .
<speaker1> Honey , cross my heart , I'v never looked at another woman since the first day I set my eyes on you ! Believe me , that's the truth .

<speaker1> What a nice day !
<speaker2> yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ?
<speaker1> great , let's go !
<speaker2> hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world .
<speaker1> exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ...
<speaker2> yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies !
<speaker1> why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .
<speaker2> are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ?
<speaker1> never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ?
<speaker2> yeah , I think so .
<speaker1> ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great .
<speaker2> wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases .
