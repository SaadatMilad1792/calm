# Compact AI Language Model (CALM)
In this project, we will design a lightweight language model called **CALM**, short for **Compact AI Language Model** (pretty neat, right?). Like other language models, CALM can interact with users by receiving a sequence of words, characters, or byte-pairs (depending on the tokenization method) and generating a probabilistic response that best fits the input.

This project is intended as a complete, end-to-end tutorial, covering everything from the fundamentals to full implementation of a compact language model. By the end, we will also build a user interface (UI) that enables direct interaction with CALM.

Overall, this tutorial is designed to be a practical, hands-on learning journey. While it requires some time, energy, and dedication, it promises to be both educational and fun.
